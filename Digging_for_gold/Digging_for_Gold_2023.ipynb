As a child I was deeply concerned in tales of spooks,\\nhaunted houses, wraiths and specters and stories of weird experiences,\\nclanking chains, ghostly sights and gruesome sounds always held me\\nspellbound and breathless.\\n\\nExperiences in editorial offices taught me that I was not alone in\\nliking stories of mystery. The desire to know something of that\\nexistence that is veiled by Death is equally potent in old age and in\\nyouth, and men, women and children like to be thrilled and to have a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccreepy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feeling along the spinal column as the result of reading of a\\nvisitor from beyond the grave.\\n\\nThis volume contains the most famous of the weird stories of Edgar Allan\\nPoe, that master of this form of literature. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Black Cat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d contains\\nall the needed element of mystery and supernatural, and yet the feline\\nacts in a natural manner all of the time, and the story is quite\\npossibly true. It is only in the manner of its telling that the tale\\nbecomes one that fittingly finds its place in this collection.\\n\\nGuy de Maupassant, the clever Frenchman, is also represented by two\\neffective bits of work, and other less widely known writers have also\\ncontributed stories that are worth reading, and when once read will be\\nremembered. There is not a story among the twenty-five that is not\\nworthy of close reading.\\n\\nThere has recently been a revival in interest in ghost stories. Many of\\nthe high-class magazines have within a few months printed stories with\\nsupernatural incidents, and writers whose names are known to all who\\nread have turned their attention to this form of literature.\\n\\nWhether or not the reader believe in ghosts, he cannot fail to be\\ninterested in this little book. Without venturing to express a positive\\nopinion either way, I will only say with Hamlet: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are more things\\nin heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nW. BOB HOLLAND.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwenty-Five Ghost Stories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BLACK CAT.\\n\\nBY EDGAR ALLAN POE.\\n\\n\\nFor the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I\\nneither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,\\nin a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I\\nnot--and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I\\nwould unburden my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the\\nworld, plainly, succinctly and without comment a series of mere\\nhousehold events. In their consequences, these events have\\nterrified--have tortured--have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to\\nexpound them. To me they have presented little but horror, to many they\\nwill seem less terrible than baroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some\\nintellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the\\ncommonplace--some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less\\nexcitable than my own, which will perceive in the circumstances I detail\\nwith awe nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes\\nand effects.\\n\\nFrom my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my\\ndisposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make\\nme the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was\\nindulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent\\nmost of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing\\nthem. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my\\nmanhood I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To\\nthose who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog,\\nI need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the\\nintensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the\\nunselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to\\nthe heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry\\nfriendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.\\n\\nI married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not\\nuncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets she\\nlost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We\\nhad birds, goldfish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey and a cat.\\n\\nThis latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,\\nand sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,\\nmy wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made\\nfrequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all\\nblack cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon\\nthis point--and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than\\nthat it happens, just now, to be remembered.\\n\\nPluto--this was the cat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name--was my favorite pet and playmate. I\\nalone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It\\nwas even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me\\nthrough the streets.\\n\\nOur friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which\\nmy general temperament and character--through the instrumentality of the\\nfiend Intemperance--had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical\\nalteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more\\nirritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself\\nto use intemperate language to my wife. At length I even offered her\\npersonal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in\\nmy disposition. I not only neglected them, but ill-used them. For Pluto,\\nhowever, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from\\nmaltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the\\nmonkey or even the dog, when by accident or through affection they came\\nin my way. But my disease grew upon me--for what disease is like\\nalcohol! And at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and\\nconsequently somewhat peevish--even Pluto began to experience the\\neffects of my ill-temper.\\n\\nOne night, returning home much intoxicated from one of my haunts about\\ntown, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him, when, in\\nhis fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with\\nhis teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no\\nlonger. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my\\nbody; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every\\nfiber of my frame. I took from my waistcoat pocket a penknife, opened\\nit, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of\\nits eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder while I pen the\\ndamnable atrocity.\\n\\nWhen reason returned with the morning--when I had slept off the fumes of\\nthe night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debauch--I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of\\nremorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,\\na feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again\\nplunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.\\n\\nIn the meantime the cat slowly recovered.\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_One night, returning home much intoxicated._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\nThe socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful\\nappearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about\\nthe house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at\\nmy approach. I had so much of my old heart left as to be at first\\ngrieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once\\nso loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And then\\ncame, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of\\nperverseness. Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not\\nmore sure that my soul lives than I am that perverseness is one of the\\nprimitive impulses of the human heart--one of the indivisible primary\\nfaculties or sentiments which give direction to the character of man.\\nWho has not, hundreds of times, found himself committing a vile or silly\\naction, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we\\nnot a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to\\nviolate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such?\\nThis spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was\\nthis unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself--to offer violence\\nto its own nature--to do wrong for the wrong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake only--that urged me\\nto continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon\\nthe unoffending brute. One morning, in cold blood, I slipped a noose\\nabout its neck, and hung it to the limb of a tree; hung it with the\\ntears streaming from my eyes and the bitterest remorse at my heart; hung\\nit because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given\\nme no offense; hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing\\na sin--a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to\\nplace it, if such a thing were possible--even beyond the reach of the\\ninfinite mercy of the most merciful and most terrible God.\\n\\nOn the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused\\nfrom sleep by the cry of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfire!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The curtains of my bed were in flames.\\nThe whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife,\\na servant and myself made our escape from the conflagration. The\\ndestruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and\\nI resigned myself thenceforward to despair.\\n\\nI am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and\\neffect between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain\\nof facts, and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On the\\nday succeeding the fire I visited the ruins. The walls, with one\\nexception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment\\nwall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and\\nagainst which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in\\ngreat measure, resisted the action of the fire--a fact which I\\nattributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense\\ncrowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a\\nparticular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrange!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingular!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and other similar expressions excited my\\ncuriosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas-relief upon the\\nwhite surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given\\nwith an accuracy truly marvelous. There was a rope about the animal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nneck.\\n\\nWhen I first beheld this apparition--for I could scarcely regard it as\\nless--my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection\\ncame to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden\\nadjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire this garden had been\\nimmediately filled by the crowd--by some one of whom the animal must\\nhave been cut from the tree and thrown through an open window into my\\nchamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from\\nsleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my\\ncruelty into the substance of the freshly spread plaster, the lime of\\nwhich with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had then\\naccomplished the portraiture as I saw it.\\n\\nAlthough I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my\\nconscience, for the\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Because I knew that it had loved me._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\nstartling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail to make a deep\\nimpression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself of the\\nphantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my\\nspirit a half sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far\\nas to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the\\nvile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the\\nsame species and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply\\nits place.\\n\\nOne night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my\\nattention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the\\nhead of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum, which\\nconstituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking\\nsteadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now\\ncaused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the\\nobject thereupon. I approached it and touched it with my hand. It was a\\nblack cat--a very large one--fully as large as Pluto, and closely\\nresembling him in every respect, but only Pluto had not a white hair\\nupon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although\\nindefinite, splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the\\nbreast.\\n\\nUpon my touching him he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against\\nmy hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was the\\nvery creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase it\\nof the landlord; but this person made no claim to it--knew nothing of\\nit--had never seen it before.\\n\\nI continued my caresses, and when I prepared to go home the animal\\nevinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so,\\noccasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached the\\nhouse it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great\\nfavorite with my wife.\\n\\nFor my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This\\nwas just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but--I know not how or\\nwhy it was--its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed\\nme. By slow degrees these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into\\nthe bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense of\\nshame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me\\nfrom physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or\\notherwise violently ill use it; but gradually--very gradually--I came to\\nlook upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its\\nodious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.\\n\\nWhat added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on\\nthe morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been\\ndeprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared\\nit to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree,\\nthat humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait,\\nand the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.\\n\\nWith my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed\\nto increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would\\nbe difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat it would\\ncrouch beneath my chair or spring upon my knees, covering me with its\\nloathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet, and\\nthus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my\\ndress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I\\nlonged to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing,\\npartly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly--let me confess it at\\nonce--by absolute dread of the beast.\\n\\nThis dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil--and yet I should be\\nat a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own--yes,\\neven in this felon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cell, I am almost ashamed to own--that the terror\\nand horror with which the animal inspired me had been heightened by one\\nof the merest chimeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife had\\ncalled my attention more than once, to the character of the mark of\\nwhite hair, of which I have spoken, and which\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_The figure of a gigantic cat._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\nconstituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and\\nthe one I had destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark,\\nalthough large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow\\ndegrees--degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time my\\nreason struggled to reject as fanciful--it had, at length, assumed a\\nrigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the representation of an\\nobject that I shudder to name--and for this, above all, I loathed and\\ndreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared--it was\\nnow I say the image of a hideous, of a ghastly thing--of the gallows!\\nOh, mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crime--of agony and of\\ndeath!\\n\\nAnd now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity.\\nAnd a brute beast, whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed--a brute\\nbeast to work out for me--for me, a man, fashioned in the image of the\\nHigh God--so much of insufferable woe. Alas! neither by day nor night\\nknew I the blessing of rest any more. During the former the creature\\nleft me no moment alone, and in the latter I started hourly from dreams\\nof unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face,\\nand its vast weight--an incarnate nightmare that I had no power to shake\\noff--incumbent eternally upon my heart.\\n\\nBeneath the pressure of torments such as these the feeble remnants of\\nthe good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole\\nintimates--the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of my\\nusual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind;\\nwhile, from the sudden, frequent and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to\\nwhich I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas! was\\nthe most usual and the most patient of sufferers.\\n\\nOne day she accompanied me upon some household errand into the cellar of\\nthe old building, which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat\\nfollowed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,\\nexasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my\\nwrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a\\nblow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal\\nhad it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of\\nmy wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal,\\nI withdrew my arm from her grasp, and buried the ax in her brain. She\\nfell dead upon the spot, without a groan.\\n\\nThis hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with\\nentire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I\\ncould not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without\\nthe risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered my\\nmind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute\\nfragments and destroying them by fire. At another I resolved to dig a\\ngrave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about\\ncasting it into the well in the yard--about packing it in a box, as if\\nmerchandise, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to\\ntake it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a far\\nbetter expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in the\\ncellar--as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up\\ntheir victims.\\n\\nFor a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were\\nloosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a\\nrough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from\\nhardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a\\nfalse chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to\\nresemble the rest of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily\\ndisplace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole\\nup as before, so that no eye could detect anything suspicious.\\n\\nAnd in this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crowbar I\\neasily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body\\nagainst the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with\\nlittle trouble, I relaid the whole structure as it originally stood.\\nHaving\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_An extraordinary cat._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\nprocured mortar, sand and hair with every possible precaution, I\\nprepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and\\nwith this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I had\\nfinished I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present\\nthe slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the\\nfloor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around triumphantly\\nand said to myself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere, at least, then, my labor has not been in\\nvain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so\\nmuch wretchedness, for I had at length firmly resolved to put it to\\ndeath. Had I been able to meet with it at the moment there could have\\nbeen no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had\\nbeen alarmed at the violence of my previous anger and forebore to\\npresent itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe or to\\nimagine the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the\\ndetested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance\\nduring the night--and thus, for one night at least since its\\nintroduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept--aye, slept,\\neven with the burden of murder upon my soul!\\n\\nThe second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.\\nOnce again I breathed as a free man. The monster, in terror, had fled\\nthe premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was\\nsupreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few\\ninquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a\\nsearch had been instituted--but, of course, nothing was to be\\ndiscovered. I looked upon my future felicity as secured.\\n\\nUpon the fourth day of the assassination a party of the police came very\\nunexpectedly into the house and proceeded again to make a rigorous\\ninvestigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of\\nmy place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers\\nbade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner\\nunexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into\\nthe cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat as calmly as that\\nof one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I\\nfolded my arms upon my bosom and roamed easily to and fro. The police\\nwere thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart\\nwas too strong to be restrained. I burned to say but one word, by way of\\ntriumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGentlemen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI delight\\nto have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health and a little\\nmore courtesy. By the by, gentlemen, this--this is a very well\\nconstructed house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (In the rabid desire to say something easily I\\nscarcely knew what I uttered at all.) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may say an excellently well\\nconstructed house. These walls--are you going, gentlemen?--these walls\\nare solidly put together;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and here, through the mere frenzy of bravado,\\nI rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very\\nportion of the brickwork behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my\\nbosom.\\n\\nBut may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch Fiend! No\\nsooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence than I was\\nanswered by a voice from within the tomb!--by a cry, at first muffled\\nand broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into\\none long, loud and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman--a\\nhowl!--a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as\\nmight have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the\\ndamned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.\\n\\nOf my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to the\\nopposite wall. For an instant the party upon the stairs remained\\nmotionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next a dozen\\nstout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already\\ngetting decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of\\nthe spectators. Upon its head, with red, extended mouth and solitary eye\\nof fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder,\\nand whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled\\nthe monster up within the tomb!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE FLAYED HAND.\\n\\nBY GUY DE MAUPASSANT.\\n\\n\\nOne evening about eight months ago I met with some college comrades at\\nthe lodgings of our friend Louis R. We drank punch and smoked, talked of\\nliterature and art, and made jokes like any other company of young men.\\nSuddenly the door flew open, and one who had been my friend since\\nboyhood burst in like a hurricane.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuess where I come from?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI bet on the Mabille,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d responded one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said another, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are too\\ngay; you come from borrowing money, from burying a rich uncle, or from\\npawning your watch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are getting sober,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried a third, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand, as\\nyou scented the punch in Louis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 room, you came up here to get drunk\\nagain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are all wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI come from P., in Normandy, where I\\nhave spent eight days, and whence I have brought one of my friends, a\\ngreat criminal, whom I ask permission to present to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith these words he drew from his pocket a long, black hand, from which\\nthe skin had been stripped. It had been severed at the wrist. Its dry\\nand shriveled shape, and the narrow, yellowed nails still clinging to\\nthe fingers, made it frightful to look upon. The muscles, which showed\\nthat its first owner had been possessed of great strength, were bound in\\nplace by a strip of parchment-like skin.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust fancy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said my friend, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe other day they sold the effects of an\\nold sorcerer, recently deceased, well known in all the country. Every\\nSaturday night he used to go to witch gatherings on a broomstick; he\\npractised the white magic and the black, gave blue milk to the cows, and\\nmade them wear tails like that of the companion of Saint Anthony. The\\nold scoundrel always had a deep affection for this hand, which, he said,\\nwas that of a celebrated criminal, executed in 1736 for having thrown\\nhis lawful wife head first into a well--for which I do not blame\\nhim--and then hanging in the belfry the priest who had married him.\\nAfter this double exploit he went away, and, during his subsequent\\ncareer, which was brief but exciting, he robbed twelve travelers, smoked\\na score of monks in their monastery, and made a seraglio of a convent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what are you going to do with this horror?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we cried.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEh! parbleu! I will make it the handle to my door-bell and frighten my\\ncreditors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Henry Smith, a big, phlegmatic Englishman, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe\\nthat this hand is only a kind of Indian meat, preserved by a new\\nprocess; I advise you to make bouillon of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRail not, messieurs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said, with the utmost sang froid, a medical\\nstudent who was three-quarters drunk, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut if you follow my advice,\\nPierre, you will give this piece of human debris Christian burial, for\\nfear lest its owner should come to demand it. Then, too, this hand has\\nacquired some bad habits, for you know the proverb, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Who has killed will\\nkill.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who has drank will drink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the host as he poured out a big\\nglass of punch for the student, who emptied it at a draught and slid\\ndead drunk under the table. His sudden dropping out of the company was\\ngreeted with a burst of laughter, and Pierre, raising his glass and\\nsaluting the hand, cried:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI drink to the next visit of thy master.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThen the conversation turned upon other subjects, and shortly afterward\\neach returned to his lodgings.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAbout two o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock the next day, as I was passing Pierre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s door, I\\nentered and found him reading and smoking.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, how goes it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he responded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd your hand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy hand? Did you not see it on the bell-pull? I put it there when I\\nreturned home last night. But, apropos of this, what do you think? Some\\nidiot, doubtless to play a stupid joke on me, came ringing at my door\\ntowards midnight. I demanded who was there, but as no one replied, I\\nwent back to bed again, and to sleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this moment the door opened and the landlord, a fat and extremely\\nimpertinent person, entered without saluting us.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI pray you to take away immediately that carrion which\\nyou have hung to your bell-pull. Unless you do this I shall be compelled\\nto ask you to leave.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d responded Pierre, with much gravity, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou insult a hand which\\ndoes not merit it. Know you that it belonged to a man of high breeding?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe landlord turned on his heel and made his exit, without speaking.\\nPierre followed him, detached the hand and affixed it to the bell-cord\\nhanging in his alcove.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis hand, like the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Brother, all must die,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nof the Trappists, will give my thoughts a serious turn every night\\nbefore I sleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt the end of an hour I left him and returned to my own apartment.\\n\\nI slept badly the following night, was nervous and agitated, and several\\ntimes awoke with a start. Once I imagined, even, that a man had broken\\ninto my room, and I sprang up and searched the closets and under the\\nbed. Towards six o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the morning I was commencing to doze at\\nlast, when a loud knocking at my door made me jump from my couch. It was\\nmy friend Pierre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s servant, half dressed, pale and trembling.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, sir!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he, sobbing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy poor master. Someone has murdered\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI dressed myself hastily and ran to Pierre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lodgings. The house was\\nfull of people disputing together, and everything was in a commotion.\\nEveryone was talking at the same time, recounting and commenting on the\\noccurrence in all sorts of ways. With great difficulty I reached the\\nbedroom, made myself known to those guarding the door and was permitted\\nto enter. Four agents of police were standing in the middle of the\\napartment, pencils in hand, examining every detail, conferring in low\\nvoices and writing from time to time in their note-books. Two doctors\\nwere in consultation by the bed on which lay the unconscious form of\\nPierre. He was not dead, but his face was fixed in an expression of the\\nmost awful terror. His eyes were open their widest, and the dilated\\npupils seemed to regard fixedly, with unspeakable horror, something\\nunknown and frightful. His hands were clinched. I raised the quilt,\\nwhich covered his body from the chin downward, and saw on his neck,\\ndeeply sunk in the flesh, the marks of fingers. Some drops of blood\\nspotted his shirt. At that moment one thing struck me. I chanced to\\nnotice that the shriveled hand was no longer attached to the bell-cord.\\nThe doctors had doubtless removed it to avoid the comments of those\\nentering the chamber where the wounded man lay, because the appearance\\nof this hand was indeed frightful. I did not inquire what had become of\\nit.\\n\\nI now clip from a newspaper of the next day the story of the crime with\\nall the details that the police were able to procure:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA frightful attempt was made yesterday on the life of young M. Pierre\\nB., student, who belongs to one of the best families in Normandy. He\\nreturned home about ten o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the evening, and excused his valet,\\nBouvin, from further attendance upon him, saying that he felt fatigued\\nand was going to bed. Towards midnight Bouvin was suddenly awakened by\\nthe furious ringing of his master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bell. He was afraid, and lighted a\\nlamp and waited. The bell was silent about a minute, then rang again\\nwith such vehemence that the domestic, mad with fright, flew from his\\nroom to awaken the concierge, who ran to summon the police, and, at the\\nend of about fifteen minutes, two policemen forced open the door. A\\nhorrible sight met their eyes. The furniture was overturned, giving\\nevidence of a fearful struggle between the victim and his assailant. In\\nthe middle of the room, upon his back, his body rigid, with livid face\\nand frightfully dilated eyes, lay, motionless, young Pierre B., bearing\\nupon his neck the deep imprints of five fingers. Dr. Bourdean was called\\nimmediately, and his report says that the aggressor must have been\\npossessed of prodigious strength and have had an extraordinarily thin\\nand sinewy hand, because the fingers left in the flesh of the victim\\nfive holes like those from a pistol ball, and had penetrated until they\\nalmost met. There is no clue to the motive of the crime or to its\\nperpetrator. The police are making a thorough investigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe following appeared in the same newspaper next day:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cM. Pierre B., the victim of the frightful assault of which we published\\nan account yesterday, has regained consciousness after two hours of the\\nmost assiduous care by Dr. Bourdean. His life is not in danger, but it\\nis strongly feared that he has lost his reason. No trace has been found\\nof his assailant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy poor friend was indeed insane. For seven months I visited him daily\\nat the hospital where we had placed him, but he did not recover the\\nlight of reason. In his delirium strange words escaped him, and, like\\nall madmen, he had one fixed idea: he believed himself continually\\npursued by a specter. One day they came for me in haste, saying he was\\nworse, and when I arrived I found him dying. For two hours he remained\\nvery calm, then, suddenly, rising from his bed in spite of our efforts,\\nhe cried, waving his arms as if a prey to the most awful terror: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake\\nit away! Take it away! It strangles me! Help! Help!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Twice he made the\\ncircuit of the room, uttering horrible screams, then fell face downward,\\ndead.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAs he was an orphan I was charged to take his body to the little village\\nof P., in Normandy, where his parents were buried. It was the place from\\nwhich he had arrived the evening he found us drinking punch in Louis\\nR.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, when he had presented to us the flayed hand. His body was\\ninclosed in a leaden coffin, and four days afterwards I walked sadly\\nbeside the old cure, who had given him his first lessons, to the little\\ncemetery where they dug his grave. It was a beautiful day, and sunshine\\nfrom a cloudless sky flooded the earth. Birds sang from the blackberry\\nbushes where many a time when we were children we had stolen to eat the\\nfruit. Again I saw Pierre and myself creeping along behind the hedge and\\nslipping through the gap that we knew so well, down at the end of the\\nlittle plot where they bury the poor. Again we would return to the house\\nwith cheeks and lips black with the juice of the berries we had eaten. I\\nlooked at the bushes; they were covered with fruit; mechanically I\\npicked some and bore it to my mouth. The cure had opened his breviary,\\nand was muttering his prayers in a low voice. I heard at the end of the\\nwalk the spades of the grave-diggers who were opening the tomb. Suddenly\\nthey called out, the cure closed his book, and we went to see what they\\nwished of us. They had found a coffin; in digging a stroke of the\\npickaxe had started the cover, and we perceived within a skeleton of\\nunusual stature, lying on its back, its hollow eyes seeming yet to\\nmenace and defy us. I was troubled, I know not why, and almost afraid.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHold!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried one of the men, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clook there! One of the rascal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands has\\nbeen severed at the wrist. Ah, here it is!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he picked up from beside\\nthe body a huge withered hand, and held it out to us.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the other, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csee how he glares at you, as if he\\nwould spring at your throat to make you give him back his hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the cure, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleave the dead in peace, and close the coffin. We\\nwill make poor Pierre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grave elsewhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe next day all was finished, and I returned to Paris, after having\\nleft fifty francs with the old cure for masses to be said for the repose\\nof the soul of him whose sepulchre we had troubled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VENGEANCE OF A TREE.\\n\\nBY ELEANOR F. LEWIS.\\n\\n\\nThrough the windows of Jim Daly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s saloon, in the little town of C----,\\nthe setting sun streamed in yellow patches, lighting up the glasses\\nscattered on the tables and the faces of several men who were gathered\\nnear the bar. Farmers mostly they were, with a sprinkling of\\nshopkeepers, while prominent among them was the village editor, and all\\nwere discussing a startling piece of news that had spread through the\\ntown and its surroundings. The tidings that Walter Stedman, a laborer on\\nAlbert Kelsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ranch, had assaulted and murdered his employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndaughter, had reached them, and had spread universal horror among the\\npeople.\\n\\nA farmer declared that he had seen the deed committed as he walked\\nthrough a neighboring lane, and, having always been noted for his\\ncowardice, instead of running to the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aid, had hailed a party of\\nminers who were returning from their mid-day meal through a field near\\nby. When they reached the spot, however, where Stedman (as they\\nsupposed) had done his black deed, only the girl lay there, in the\\nstillness of death. Her murderer had taken the opportunity to fly. The\\nparty had searched the woods of the Kelsey estate, and just as they were\\nnearing the house itself the appearance of Walter Stedman, walking in a\\nstrangely unsteady manner toward it, made them quicken their pace.\\n\\nHe was soon in custody, although he had protested his innocence of the\\ncrime. He said that he had just seen the body himself on his way to the\\nstation, and that when they had found him he was going to the house for\\nhelp. But they had laughed at his story and had flung him into the tiny,\\nstifling calaboose of the town.\\n\\nWhat were their proofs? Walter Stedman, a young fellow of about\\ntwenty-six, had come from the city to their quiet town, just when times\\nwere at their hardest, in search of work. The most of the men living in\\nthe town were honest fellows, doing their work faithfully, when they\\ncould get it, and when they had socially asked Stedman to have a drink\\nwith them, he had refused in rather a scornful manner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat infernal\\ncity chap,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he was called, and their hate and envy increased in strength\\nwhen Albert Kelsey had employed him in preference to any of themselves.\\nAs time went on, the story of Stedman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s admiration for Margaret Kelsey\\nhad gone afloat, with the added information that his employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndaughter had repulsed him, saying that she would not marry a common\\nlaborer. So Stedman, when this news reached his employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ears, was\\ndischarged, and this, then, was his revenge! For them, these proofs were\\nsufficient to pronounce him guilty.\\n\\nYet that afternoon, as Stedman, crouched on the floor of the calaboose,\\ngrew hopeless in the knowledge that no one would believe his story, and\\nthat his undeserved punishment would be swift and sure, a tramp,\\nboarding a freight car several miles from the town, sped away from the\\nspot where his crime had been committed, and knew that forever its\\nshadow would follow him.\\n\\nFrom the tiny window of his prison Walter Stedman could see the red glow\\nof the heavens that betokened the setting of the sun. So the red sun of\\nhis life was soon to set, a life that had been innocent of all crime,\\nand that now was to be ended for a deed that he had never committed.\\nMost prominent of all the visions that swept through his mind was that\\nof Margaret Kelsey, lying as he had first found her, fresh from the\\nhands of her murderer. But there was another of a more tender nature.\\nHow long he and Margaret had tried to keep their secret, until Walter\\ncould be promoted to a higher position, so that he could ask for her\\nhand with no fear of the father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s antagonism! Then came the remembrance\\nof an afternoon meeting between the two in the woods of the Kelsey\\nestate--how, just as they were parting, Walter had heard footsteps near\\nthem, and, glancing sharply around, saw an evil, scowling, murderous\\nface peering through the brush. He had started toward it, but the owner\\nof the countenance had taken himself hurriedly off.\\n\\nThe gossiping townspeople had misconstrued this romance, and when Albert\\nKelsey had heard of this clandestine meeting from the man who was later\\non to appear as a leader of the mob, and that he had discharged Stedman,\\nthey had believed that the young man had formally proposed and had been\\nrejected. But justice had gone wrong, as it had done innumerable times\\nbefore, and will again. An innocent man was to be hanged, even without\\nthe comfort of a trial, while the man who was guilty was free to wander\\nwhere he would.\\n\\nThat autumn night the darkness came quickly, and only the stars did\\ntheir best to light the scene. A body of men, all masked, and having as\\na leader one who had ever since Stedman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arrival in town, cherished a\\nsecret hatred of the young man, dragged Stedman from the calaboose and\\ntramped through the town, defying all, defying even God himself. Along\\nthe highway, and into Farmer Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccross cut,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they went, vigilantly\\nguarding their prisoner, who, with the lanterns lighting up his haggard\\nface, walked among them with the lagging step of utter hopelessness.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good tree,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their leader said, presently, stopping and\\npointing out a spreading oak; when the slipknot was adjusted and Stedman\\nhad stepped on the box, he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got anything to say, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\nbetter say it now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am innocent, I swear before God,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doomed man answered; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never\\ntook the life of Margaret Kelsey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive us your proof,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jeered the leader, and when Stedman kept a\\ndespairing silence, he laughed shortly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReady, men!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he gave the order. The box was kicked aside, and\\nthen--only a writhing body swung to and fro in the gloom.\\n\\nIn front of the men stood their leader, watching the contortions of the\\nbody with silent glee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you a secret, boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said suddenly.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was after that poor murdered girl myself. A d---- little chance I\\nhad; but, by ----, he had just as little!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA pause--then: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shunted this earth. Cut him down, you fellows!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use, son. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give up the blasted thing as a bad job. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsomething queer about that there tree. Do you see how its branches\\nbalance it? We have cut the trunk nearly in two, but it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come down.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plenty of others around; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take one of them. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d a long\\nrope with me I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get that tree down, and yet the way the thing stands it\\nwould be risking a fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life to climb it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got the devil in it,\\nsure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo old Farmer Brown shouldered his axe and made for another tree, his\\nson following. They had sawed and chopped and chopped and sawed, and yet\\nthe tall white oak, with its branches jutting out almost as regularly as\\nif done by the work of a machine, stood straight and firm.\\n\\nFarmer Brown, well known for his weak, cowardly spirit, who in beholding\\nthe murder of Albert Kelsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, had in his fright mistaken the\\ncriminal, now in his superstition let the oak stand, because its\\nwell-balanced position saved it from falling, when other trees would\\nhave been down. And so this tree, the same one to which an innocent man\\nhad been hanged, was left--for other work.\\n\\nIt was a bleak, rainy night--such a night as can be found only in\\ncentral California. The wind howled like a thousand demons, and lashed\\nthe trees together in wild embraces. Now and then the weird \\xe2\\x80\\x9choot,\\nhoot!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of an owl came softly from the distance in the lulls of the\\nstorm, while the barking of coyotes woke the echoes of the hills into\\nsounds like fiendish laughter.\\n\\nIn the wind and rain a man fought his path through the bush and into\\nFarmer Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccross cut,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the shortest way home. Suddenly he\\nstopped, trembling, as if held by some unseen impulse. Before him rose\\nthe white oak, wavering and swaying in the storm.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood God! it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the tree I swung Stedman from!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, and a strange\\nfear thrilled him.\\n\\nHis eyes were fixed on it, held by some undefinable fascination. Yes,\\nthere on one of the longest branches a small piece of rope still\\ndangled. And then, to the murderer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excited vision, this rope seemed to\\nlengthen, to form at the end into a slipknot, a knot that encircled a\\npurple neck, while below it writhed and swayed the body of a man!\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDamn him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he muttered, starting toward the hanging form, as if about\\nto help the rope in its work of strangulation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill he forever follow\\nme? And yet he deserved it, the black-hearted villain! He took her\\nlife----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe never finished the sentence. The white oak, towering above him in its\\nstrength, seemed to grow like a frenzied, living creature. There was a\\nsudden splitting sound, then came a crash, and under the fallen tree lay\\nStedman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s murderer, crushed and mangled.\\n\\nFrom between the broken trunk and the stump that was left, a gray, dim\\nshape sprang out, and sped past the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still form, away into the wild\\nblackness of the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PARLOR-CAR GHOST.\\n\\n\\nAll draped with blue denim--the seaside cottage of my friend, Sara Pyne.\\nShe asked me to go there with her when she opened it to have it set in\\norder for the summer. She confessed that she felt a trifle nervous at\\nthe idea of entering it alone. And I am always ready for an excursion.\\nSo much blue denim rather surprised me, because blue is not\\ncomplimentary to Sara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complexion--she always wears some shade of red,\\nby preference. She perceived my wonder; she is very near-sighted, and\\ntherefore sees everything by some sort of sixth sense.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou do not like my portieres and curtains and table-covers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeither do I. But I did it to accommodate. And now he rests well in his\\ngrave, I hope.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhose grave, for pity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. J. Billington Price\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who is he? He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sound interesting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I will tell you about him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sara, taking a seat directly in\\nfront of one of those curtains. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast autumn I was leaving this place\\nfor New York, traveling on the fast express train known as the Flying\\nYankee. Of course, I thought of the Flying Dutchman and Wagner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s musical\\nsetting of the uncanny legend, and how different things are in these\\ndays of steam, etc. Then I looked out of the window at the landscape,\\nthe horizon that seemed to wheel in a great curve as the train sped on.\\nEvery now and then I had an impression at the \\xe2\\x80\\x98tail of the eye\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that a\\nman was sitting in a chair three or four numbers in front of me on the\\nopposite side of the car. Each time that I saw this shape I looked at\\nthe chair and ascertained that it was unoccupied. But it was an odd\\ntrick of vision. I raised my lorgnette, and the chair showed emptier\\nthan before. There was nobody in it, certainly. But the more I knew that\\nit was vacant the more plainly I saw the man. Always with the corner of\\nmy eye. It made me nervous. When passengers entered the car I dreaded\\nlest they might take that seat. What would happen if they should? A bag\\nwas put in the chair--that made me uncomfortable. The bag was removed at\\nthe next station. Then a baby was placed in the seat. It began to laugh\\nas though someone had gently tickled it. There was something odd about\\nthat chair--thirteen was its number. When I looked away from it the\\nimpression was strong upon me that some person sitting there was\\nwatching me.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReally, it would not do to humor such fancies. So I touched the\\nelectric button, asked the porter to bring me a table, and taking from\\nmy bag a pack of cards, proceeded to divert myself with a game of\\npatience. I was puzzling where to put a seven of spades. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Where can it\\ngo?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I murmured to myself. A voice behind me prompted: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Play the four of\\ndiamonds on the five, and you can do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I started. The only occupants\\nof the car, besides me, were a bridal couple, a mother with three little\\nchildren, and a typical preacher of one of the straitest sects. Who had\\nspoken? \\xe2\\x80\\x98Play up the four, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 repeated this voice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI looked fearfully over my shoulder. At first I saw a bluish cloud,\\nlike cigar smoke, but inodorous. Then the vision cleared, and I saw a\\nyoung man whom I knew by a subtle intuition to be the occupant, seen and\\nnot seen, of chair number thirteen. Evidently he was a traveling\\nsalesman--and a ghost. Of course, a drummer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ghost sounds\\nridiculous--they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so extremely alive! Or else you would expect a dead\\ndrummer to be particularly dead and not \\xe2\\x80\\x98walk.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 This was a most\\ncommonplace-looking ghost, cordial, pushing, businesslike. At the same\\ntime, his face had an expression of utter despair and horror which made\\nhim still more preposterous. Of course it is not nice to let a stranger\\nspeak to one, even on so impersonal a topic as a four of diamonds. But a\\nghost--there can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be any rule of etiquette about talking with a ghost!\\nMy dear, it was dreadful! That forward creature showed me how to play\\nall the cards, and then begged me to lay them out again, in order that\\nhe might give me some clever points. I was too much amazed and disturbed\\nto speak. I could only place the cards at his suggestion. This I did so\\nas not to appear to be listening to the empty air, and be supposed to be\\na crazy woman. Presently the ghost spoke again, and told me his story.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I have been riding back and forth on this car ever\\nsince February 22, 189--. Seven months and eleven days. All this time I\\nhave not exchanged a word with anyone. For a drummer, that is pretty\\nhard, you may believe! You know the story of the Flying Dutchman? Well,\\nthat is very nearly my case. A curse is upon me and will not be removed\\nuntil some kind soul----. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting ahead of my text. That day\\nthere were four of us, traveling for different houses. One of the boys\\nwas in wool, one in baking powder, one in boots and shoes, and myself in\\ncotton goods. We met on the road, took seats together and fell into\\ntalking shop.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Those fellows told big lies about their sales, Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Birthday\\nthough it was. The baking powder man raised the amount of the bills of\\ngoods which he had sold better than a whole can of his stuff could have\\ndone. I admitted the straight truth, that I had not yet been able to\\nmake a sale. And then I swore--not in a light-minded, chipper style of\\nverbal trimmings, but a great, round, heaven-defying oath--that I would\\nsell a case of blue denims on that trip if it took me forever. We became\\ndry with talk, and when the train stopped at Rivermouth, we went out to\\nhave some beer. It is good there, you know--pardon me, I forgot that I\\nwas speaking to a lady. Well, we had to run to get aboard. I missed my\\nfooting, fell under the wheels, and the next thing that I knew they were\\nholding an inquest over my remains; while I, disemboweled, was sitting\\non a corner of the undertaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s table, wondering which of the coroner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\njury was likely to want a case of blue denims.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then I remembered my wicked oath, and understood that I was a soul\\ndoomed to wander until I could succeed in selling that bill of goods. I\\nspoke once or twice, offering the denims under value, but nobody noticed\\nme. Verdict: accidental death; negligence of deceased; railroad\\ncorporation not to blame; deceased got out for beer at his own risk. The\\nother drummers took charge of the remains, and wrote a beautiful letter\\nto my relatives about my social qualities and my impressive\\nconversation. I wish it had been less impressive that time! I might have\\nlied about my sales, or I might have said that I hoped for better luck.\\nBut after that oath there was nothing for it. Back and forth, back and\\nforth, on this road, in chair number thirteen, to all eternity. Nobody\\nsuspects my presence. They sit on my knees--I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m playing in luck when it\\nis a nice baby as it was this afternoon! They pile wraps, bags, even\\nrailway literature on me. They play cards under my nose--and what\\nduffers some of them are! You, madam, are the first person who has\\nperceived me; and therefore I ventured to speak to you, meaning no\\noffense. I can see that you are sorry for me. Now, if you recall the\\nstory of the Flying Dutchman, he was saved by the charity of a good\\nwoman. In fact, Senta married him. Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not asking anything of that\\nsize. I see that you wear a wedding ring, and no doubt you make some\\nman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happiness. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a marrying man myself, and, naturally, am not\\na marrying ghost. And that has nothing to do with the matter anyway. But\\nif you could--I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose you would have any use for them--but if\\nyou were disposed to do a turn of good, solid, Christian charity--I\\nshould be everlastingly grateful, and you may have that case of denims\\nat $72.50. And that quality is quoted to-day at $80. Does it go, madam?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe speech of the poor ghost was not very eloquent, but his eyes had an\\nintense, eager glare, which was terrible. Something--pity, fear, I do\\nnot know what--compelled me. I decided to do without that white and gold\\nevening cloak. Instead, I gave $72.50 to the ghost and took from him a\\nreceipt for the sum, signed J. Billington Price. Then he smiled\\ncontentedly, thanked me with emotion, and returned to chair number\\nthirteen. Several times on the journey, although I did not perceive him\\nagain, I felt dazed. When the train arrived at New York, and I, with the\\nother passengers, dismounted, it seemed to me that a strong hand passed\\nunder my elbow, steadying me down the steps. As I walked the length of\\nthe station my bag--not heavy at any time--appeared to become\\nweightless. I believe that the parlor-car ghost walked beside me,\\ncarrying the bag, whose handle still remained in my other hand. Indeed,\\nonce or twice I thought I felt the touch of cold fingers against mine.\\nSince then I have no reason to suppose that the poor ghost is not at\\nrest. I hope he is.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I never expected nor wished for the blue denims. The next day,\\nhowever, a dray belonging to a great wholesale house backed up to our\\ndoor and delivered a case of denims, with a receipted bill for the same.\\nWhat was I to do? I could not go about selling blue denims; I could not\\ngive them away without exciting comment. So I furnished the cottage with\\nthem--and you know the effect on my complexion. Pity me, dear! And\\ncredit me, frivolous woman as I am, with having saved a soul at the\\nexpense of my own vanity. My story is told. What do you think about\\nit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGHOST OF BUCKSTOWN INN.\\n\\nBY ARNOLD M. ANDERSON.\\n\\n\\nSeveral travel-worn drummers sat in the lobby exchanging yarns. It was\\nRodney Green\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turn, and he looked wise and began his tale.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t claim, by any means, that the belief in ghosts is a general\\nthing in Arkansas, but I do say that I had an experience out there a few\\nyears ago.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was late in the fall, and I happened to be in the village of\\nBuckstown, which desecrates a very limited portion of the State. The\\ntown is about as small and dirty a place as ever I saw, and the\\nBuckstown Inn is not much above the general character of the place. The\\nregion is inhabited by natives who still cling to all sorts of foolish\\nsuperstitions. The inn, in the ante-bellum days, was kept by one who was\\nsaid to be the meanest and most crabbed of mortals. The old demon was as\\nmiserly as he was mean, and all his narrow life he hoarded his filthy\\nlucre with fiendish greed. Report had it also that he had even murdered\\nhis patrons in their beds for their money. What the facts actually were\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, but even to this day the old inn is held in suspicion. A\\nlingering effect of former horrors still clouds its memory.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe present proprietor, Bunk Watson--his real name is Bunker, I\\nbelieve--is an altogether different sort of chap--a Southern type, in\\nfact--one of those shiftless, heedless, happy-go-lucky mortals who loves\\nstrong whiskey and who chews an enormous quid of black tobacco and\\nsmokes a corncob pipe at the same time.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen the former keeper \\xe2\\x80\\x98shuffled off,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 his property fell to a distant\\nrelative, the present keeper, who, with his family, immediately moved in\\nfrom a neighboring hamlet and took possession. It was well known that\\nthe old proprietor had accumulated considerable wealth during his\\nsojourn among the living, but all efforts to discover any treasure upon\\nthe premises had failed, and now the idea of ever finding it was\\npractically given up. As far as Bunk was concerned, the matter troubled\\nhim little. He had a hard-working wife who ran things the best she could\\nunder the circumstances, and saw that his meals were forthcoming at\\ntheir respective intervals. What more could he wish? Why should he care\\nif there was a treasure buried upon his place? Indeed, it would have\\nbeen a sore puzzle for him to know what to do with a fortune unless\\nperhaps his wife came to his aid.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmong the stories that hovered in the history of the Buckstown Inn was\\none which involved a ghost. In the room where the former keeper had died\\npeculiar noises were heard at unearthly hours: sighing, moaning, and, in\\nfact, all the other indications which point to the existence of ghosts,\\nwere said to be present. On account of this the chamber had long since\\nbeen abandoned.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI listened with keen interest to the wonderful tales about the haunted\\nroom, and then suddenly resolved to investigate--to sleep in that\\nchamber that very night and see for myself all that was to be seen. I\\ntold Buck of my purpose. He shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, but\\ninstead of warning me and offering a flood of protests, as I expected,\\nhe merely took his pipe from his mouth, let fly a quart or so of\\nyellowish juice from between a pair of brown-stained lips, and, opening\\none corner of his wide mouth, lazily called out: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Jane.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 His wife\\nappeared, and he intimated that I should settle the matter with the \\xe2\\x80\\x98old\\nwoman.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The prospect of a fee persuaded the wife, and off she went to\\narrange for my bed in that ill-fated room.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt nine o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock that evening I bid the family good-night, took my\\ncandle, ascended the rickety stairs and entered the chamber of horrors.\\nThe atmosphere was heavy and had a peculiar odor that was not at all\\npleasing. However, I latched the door and was soon in bed. Having\\npropped myself up with pillows, I was prepared to await the coming of\\nthe ghost.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOverhead the dusty rafters, which once had experienced the sensation of\\nbeing whitewashed, but which were now a dirty, yellowish color, were\\nhung with a fantastic array of cobwebs. The flickering light of the\\ncandle reflected upon the walls and against the ceiling a pyramid of\\ngrotesque shapes, and with this effect being continually disturbed by\\nthe swaying cobwebs, the whole caused the room to appear rather ghostly\\nafter all, and especially so to an imaginative mind.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI waited and waited for hours, it seemed, but still no ghost. Perhaps\\nit was afraid of my candle light, so I blew it out. No sooner had I done\\nthis and settled back in bed again than a white hand appeared through\\nthe door, then a whole figure--at last the ghost had come, a white and\\nsheeted ghost!\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt had come right through the door, although it was locked, and now it\\nadvanced toward the bed. Raising its long, white arm, it pointed a bony\\nfinger at me, and then commanded: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Come with me!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Thereupon it turned to\\nthe door, while instantly I jumped out of bed to follow. Some unseen\\npower compelled me to obey. The door flew open and the ghost led me down\\nthe stairs, through long halls into the cellar, through mysterious\\nunderground corridors, upstairs again, in and out rooms which I never\\ndreamed were to be found in that old rambling inn. Finally, through a\\nsmall door in the rear, we left the house. I was in my sleeping\\ngarments, but no matter, I had to follow.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe white form, with a slow and measured tread and as silent as death,\\nled the way into the orchard. There, under a tree at the farther end, it\\npointed to the ground, and in the same ghostly tones before used, said:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Here you will find a great treasure buried.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ghost then disappeared, and I saw it no more. I stood dazed and\\ntrembling. Upon recovering my wits I started to dig, but the chill of\\nthe night air and the scantiness of my night robes made such labor\\nimpracticable. So I decided to leave some mark to identify the place and\\ncome around again at daybreak. I reached up and broke off a limb.\\nOvercome with my night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exertions I slept the next morning until a loud\\nrapping on my door and a croaking voice warned me that it was noon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had intended to leave Buckstown Inn that day, but, prompted by\\ncuriosity and anxious to investigate, I unpacked my gripsack for a\\ncomfortable stay.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must understand that this was my first experience with a ghost, and\\nI feared I might never see another.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt breakfast my landlady waited on me in silence, though once I\\ndetected her eyes following me with a peculiar expression. She wanted to\\nask me how I enjoyed the night, but I would not gratify her by\\nvolunteering a word.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy host was more outspoken.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Reckon ye didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get much sleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said he, with a queer smile.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Did you hear anything?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I did--ye-es,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said, with a drawl. \\xe2\\x80\\x98But ye didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disturb me\\nany. I knew ye\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hev trouble when ye went in thet room ter sleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat afternoon I slipped out to the tree. But to my amazement I found\\nthat the twig I had broken from the branches was gone. Finally I found\\nunder the lower trunk of an apple tree an open place from which a small\\nbranch had evidently been wrested. But on looking further, I discovered\\nthat every apple tree in the orchard had been similarly disfigured.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98More mysterious than ever,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but to-night shall decide.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat night I pleaded weariness, which no one seemed inclined to\\nquestion, and sought my couch earlier.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ter try it again?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 asked my host.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes; and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay all winter but what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get even with that ghost,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nI said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat night I kept the candle burning until midnight, when I blew it\\nout.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstantly the room was flooded with a soft light, and at the foot of\\nthe bed stood my ghost, the identical ghost of last night.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgain the bony finger beckoned and a sepulchral voice whispered,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Follow me!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I sprang from the bed, but the figure darted ahead of me.\\nIt flew through the doorway and down the stairs, and I after it. At the\\nfoot of the staircase an unseen hand reached forward and caught my foot\\nand I fell sprawling headlong.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in a second I was on my feet and pursuing the ghost. It had gained\\non me a few yards, but I was quicker, and just as we reached the outside\\ndoor I nearly touched its robes. They sent a chill through my frame, and\\nI nearly gave up the pursuit.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs it passed through the doorway it turned and gave me one look, and I\\ncaught the same malignant light in its eyes that I remembered from the\\nnight before.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the open orchard I felt sure I could catch it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut my ghost had no intention of allowing me any such opportunity. To\\nmy disgust, it darted backward and into the house, slamming the door in\\nmy face.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn my frenzy of fear and chagrin I threw myself against the oaken door\\nwith such force that its rusty old hinges yielded and I landed in the\\nbig front room of the inn just in time to see the white skirts of the\\nghost flit up the stairs.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpstairs I flew after it, and into an old chamber. There, huddled in a\\ncorner, I saw it. In the minute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delay it had secured a lighted candle\\nand, as I entered, it advanced to daunt me with bony arm upraised to a\\ngreat height.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Caught!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I cried, throwing my arms around the figure. And I had made\\nthe acquaintance of a real live ghost.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe white robes fell, and I saw revealed my hostess of Buckstown Inn.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNext morning, when I threatened to call the police, she confessed to me\\nthat she masqueraded as a ghost to draw visitors to the out-of-the-way\\nold place, and that she found its tale of being haunted highly\\nprofitable to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BURGLAR\\xe2\\x80\\x99S GHOST.\\n\\n\\nI am not an imaginative man, and no one who knows me can say that I have\\never indulged in sentimental ideas upon any subject. I am rather\\npredisposed, in fact, to look at everything from a purely practical\\nstandpoint, and this quality has been further developed in me by the\\nfact that for twenty years I have been an active member of the detective\\npolice force at Westford, a large town in one of our most important\\nmanufacturing districts. A policeman, as most people will readily\\nbelieve, has to deal with so much practical life that he has small\\nopportunity for developing other than practical qualities, and he is\\nmore apt to believe in tangible things than in ideas of a somewhat\\nsuperstitious nature. However, I was once under the firm conviction that\\nI had been largely helped up the ladder of life by the ghost of a once\\nwell-known burglar. I have told the story to many, and have heard it\\ncommented upon in various fashions. Whether the comments were satirical\\nor practical, it made no difference to me; I had a firm faith at that\\ntime in the truth of my tale.\\n\\nEighteen years ago I was a plain clothes officer at Westford. I was then\\ntwenty-three years of age, and very anxious about two matters. First and\\nforemost I desired promotion; second, I wished to be married. Of course\\nI was more eager about the second than the first, because my sweetheart,\\nAlice Moore, was one of the prettiest and cleverest girls in the town;\\nbut I put promotion first for the simple reason that with me promotion\\nmust come before marriage. Knowing this, I was always on the lookout for\\na chance of distinguishing myself, and I paid such attention to my\\nduties that my superiors began to notice me, and foretold a successful\\ncareer for me in the future.\\n\\nOne evening in the last week of September, 1873, I was sitting in my\\nlodgings wondering what I could do to earn the promotion which I so\\nearnestly wished for. Things were quiet just then in Westford, and I am\\nafraid I half wished that something dreadful might occur if I only could\\nhave a share in it. I was pursuing this train of thought when I suddenly\\nheard a voice say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood evening, officer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI turned sharply around. It was almost dusk and my lamp was not lighted.\\nFor all that, I could see clearly enough a man who was sitting by a\\nchest of drawers that stood between the door and the window. His chair\\nstood between the drawers and the door, and I concluded that he had\\nquietly entered my room and seated himself before addressing me.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood evening!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear you come in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe laughed when I said that--a low, chuckling, rather sly laugh. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhe said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dessay not, officer. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a very quiet sort of person. You\\nmight say, in fact, noiseless. Just so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked at him narrowly, feeling considerably surprised and astonished\\nat his presence. He was a thickly built man, with a square face and\\nheavy chin. His nose was small, but aggressive; his eyes were little and\\novershadowed by heavy eyebrows; I could see them twinkle when he spoke.\\nAs for his dress, it was in keeping with his face.\\n\\nHe wore a rough suit of woolen or frieze; a thick, gayly colored Belcher\\nneckerchief encircled his bull-like throat, and in his big hands he\\ncontinually twirled and twisted a fur cap, made apparently out of the\\nskin of some favorite dog. As he sat there smiling at me and saying\\nnothing, it made me feel uncomfortable.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want with me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust a little matter o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou should have gone to the office,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to do\\nbusiness at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight you are, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I wanted to see you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s you\\nthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to do my job. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ha\\xe2\\x80\\x99 seen the superintendent he might\\nha\\xe2\\x80\\x99 put somebody else on to it. That wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ha\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suited me. You see,\\nofficer, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re young, and nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99rally eager-like for promotion. Eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I inquired again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAin\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you eager to be promoted?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reiterated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAin\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you now,\\nofficer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI saw no reason why I should conceal the fact, even from this strange\\nvisitor. I admitted that I was eager for promotion.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, with a satisfied smile; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make you\\nall the keener. Now, officer, you listen to me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a-goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to put you\\non to a nice little job. Ah! I dessay you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a sergeant before long,\\nyou will. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be complimented and praised for your clever conduck in\\nthis \\xe2\\x80\\x99ere affair. Mark my words if you ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut with it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said, fancying I saw through the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meaning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\ngoing to split on some of your pals, I suppose, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want a\\nreward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe shook his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA reward,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be no use to me at\\nall--no, not if it was a thousand pounds. No, it ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t nothing to do\\nwith reward. But now, officer, did you ever hear of Light Toed Jim?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLight Toed Jim! I should have been a poor detective if I had not. Why,\\nthe man known under that sobriquet was one of the cleverest burglars and\\nthieves in England, and had enjoyed such a famous career that his name\\nwas a household word. At that moment there was an additional interest\\nattached to him. He had been convicted of burglary at the Northminster\\nassizes in 1871, and sentenced to ten years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 penal servitude. After\\nserving nearly two years of his time he had escaped from Portland,\\ngetting away in such clever fashion that he had never been heard of\\nsince. Where he was no one could say; but lately there had been a strong\\nsuspicion among the police that Light Toed Jim was at his old tricks\\nagain.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLight Toed Jim!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I repeated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should think so. Why, what do you know\\nabout him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe smiled and nodded his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLight Toed Jim,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis in\\nWestford at this \\xe2\\x80\\x99ere hidentical moment. Listen to me, officer. Light\\nToed Jim is a-goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to crack a crib to-night. Said crib is the mansion\\nof Miss Singleton, that \\xe2\\x80\\x99ere rich old lady as lives out on the Mapleton\\nRoad. You know her--awfully rich, with naught but women servants and\\nanimals about the place. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some very valyable plate there. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nwhat Light Toed Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s after. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get in through the scullery window\\nabout 1 a. m., then he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pass through the back and front kitchens and\\ninto the butler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pantry--only it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a butleress, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cos there ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no men\\nat all--and there he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll set to work on the safe. Some of his late pals\\nin Portland give him the tip about this \\xe2\\x80\\x99ere job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did you come to hear of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mind, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor. You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. Now, I wants you to be up\\nthere to-night and to nab Light Toed Jim red-handed, so to speak. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\nmean promotion for you, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll suit me down to the ground. You wants\\nto be about and to watch him enter. Then follow him and dog him. And be\\narmed, officer, for Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fight like a tiger if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t draw his\\nteeth first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, look here, my man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is all very well, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all\\nirregular. You must just tell me who you are and how you come to be in\\nLight Toed Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secrets, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll put it down in black and white.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI turned away from him to get my writing materials. I was not half a\\nminute with my back to him, but when I turned round he was gone. The\\ndoor was shut, but I had heard no sound from it either opening or\\nshutting. Quick as thought I darted to it, tore it wide open, and looked\\ndown the narrow staircase. There was no one there. I ran hastily\\ndownstairs into the passage, and found my landlady, Mrs. Marriner,\\nstanding at the open door with a female friend. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Marriner,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said,\\nbreaking in upon their conversation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich way did that man go who came\\ndownstairs just now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Marriner looked at me strangely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been no man come\\ndownstairs, Mr. Parker,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleastways, not this good\\nthree-quarters of an hour, which me and Missis Higgins \\xe2\\x80\\x99ere, as \\xe2\\x80\\x99ave\\ncome out to take an airing, her having been ironin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 all this blessed\\nday, has been standin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x99ere all the time and ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t never seen a soul.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man came down from my room just now--the man you\\nsent up twenty minutes since.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Marriner looked at me with an expression betokening the most\\nprofound astonishment. Mrs. Higgins sighed deeply.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Parker,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Marriner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csorry am I to say it, sir, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\neither intoxicated or else you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a-sickening for brain fever, sir.\\nThere ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no person entered this door, in or out, for nigh onto an\\nhour, as me and Missis Higgins \\xe2\\x80\\x99ere will take our Bible oaths on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI went upstairs and looked in the rooms on either side of mine. The man\\nwas not there. I looked under my bed, and of course he was not there. He\\nmust have gone downstairs. But then the women must have seen him. There\\nwas only one door to the house. I gave it up in despair and began to\\nsmoke my pipe. By the time I had drawn the last whiff I decided that if\\nanyone was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintoxicated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it was probably Mrs. Marriner and Mrs.\\nHiggins, and that my strange visitor had departed by the door. I was not\\ngoing to believe that he had anything supernatural about him.\\n\\nI had no duty that night, and as the hours wore on I found myself stern\\nin my resolve to go up to Miss Singleton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house and see what I could\\nmake out of my informant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story. It was my opinion that my late visitor\\nwas a whilom \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Light Toed Jim, and that having become aware of\\nthe latter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plot, he had, for some reason of his own, decided to split\\non his old chum. Thieves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disagreement is an honest man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opportunity,\\nand I determined to solve the truth of the story told me. Lest it should\\ncome to nothing, I decided not to report the matter to my chief. If I\\ncould really capture Light Toed Jim, my success would be all the more\\nbrilliant by being suddenly sprung upon the authorities.\\n\\nI made my plan of action rapidly. I took a revolver with me and went up\\nto Miss Singleton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house. Fortunately, I knew the housekeeper there--a\\nmiddle-aged, strong-minded woman, not easily frightened, which was a\\ngood thing. To her I communicated such information as I considered\\nnecessary. She consented to conceal me in the room where the safe stood.\\nThere was a cupboard close by the safe from which I could command a full\\nview of the burglar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations and pounce upon him at the right\\nmoment. If only my information was to be relied upon, there was every\\nchance of my capturing the famous burglar.\\n\\nSoon after midnight, when the house was all quiet, I went to the pantry\\nand got into the cupboard, locking myself in. There were two openings\\nin the panel, through either of which I was able to command a full view\\nof the room. My position was somewhat cramped, but the time soon passed\\naway. My mind was principally occupied in wondering if I was really\\nabout to have a chance of distinguishing myself. Somehow, there was an\\nair of unreality about the events of the evening which puzzled me.\\n\\nSuddenly I heard a sound which put me on the alert at once. It was\\nnothing more than the creaking of a board or opening of a door would\\nmake in a quiet house; but it sounded intensified to my expectant ears.\\nI drew myself up against the door of the cupboard and placed my eye to\\nthe opening in the panel. I had oiled the key of the door, and kept my\\nfingers upon it in readiness to spring upon the burglar at the proper\\nmoment. After what seemed some time I saw the gleam of light through the\\nkeyhole of the door opening into the pantry. Then it opened, and a man\\ncarrying a small lantern came gently into the room. At first I could see\\nnothing of his face; but when my eyes grew accustomed to the hazy light\\nI saw that I had been rightly informed, and that the burglar was indeed\\nno other than the famous Light Toed Jim.\\n\\nAs I stood there watching him I could not help admiring the cool fashion\\nin which he went to work. He went over to the window and examined it. He\\ntried the door of the cupboard in which I stood concealed. Then he\\nlocked the door of the pantry and turned his attention to the safe. He\\nset his lamp on a chair before the lock and took from his pocket as neat\\nand pretty a collection of tools as ever I saw. With these he went\\nquietly and swiftly to work.\\n\\nLight Toed Jim was a somewhat slimly built fellow, with little muscular\\ndevelopment about him, while I am a big man with plenty of bone and\\nsinew. If matters had come to a fight between us I could have done what\\nI pleased with him; but I knew that Jim would not chance a fight.\\nSomewhere about him I felt sure there was a revolver, which he would use\\non the least provocation. My plan, therefore, was to wait until his back\\nwas bent over the lock of the safe, then to open the cupboard door\\nnoiselessly and fall bodily upon him, pinning him to the ground beneath\\nme.\\n\\nBefore long the moment came. He was working steadily away at the lock,\\nhis whole attention concentrated on the job. The slight noise of his\\ndrill was sufficient to drown the faint click of the key in the cupboard\\ndoor. I turned it quickly and tumbled right upon him, driving the tool\\nout of his hands and tumbling him into a heap at the foot of the safe.\\nHe uttered an exclamation of rage and astonishment as he went down, and\\nimmediately began to wriggle under me like an eel. As I kept him down\\nwith one hand I tried to pull out the handcuffs with the other. This\\nsomewhat embarrassed me, and the burglar profited by it to pull out a\\nsharp knife. He had worked himself round on his back, and before I\\nrealized what he was after he was hacking furiously at me with his keen,\\ndagger-like blade. Then I realized that we were going to have a fight\\nfor it, and prepared myself. He tried to run the knife into my side. I\\nwarded it off, but the blade caught the fleshy part of my left arm and I\\nfelt a warm stream of blood spurt out.\\n\\nThat maddened me, and I seized one of the steel drills lying near at\\nhand, and hit my man such a blow over the temple that he collapsed at\\nonce, and lay as if dead. I put the handcuffs on him instantly, and, to\\nmake matters still more certain, I secured his ankles. Then I rose and\\nlooked at my arm. The knife had made a nasty gash, and the blood was\\nflowing freely, but it was not serious; and when the housekeeper, who\\nhad just then appeared on the scene, had bandaged it, I went out and\\nsecured the help of the first policeman I met in conveying Light Toed\\nJim to the office.\\n\\nI felt a proud man when I made my report to the inspector.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLight Toed Jim?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat, James Bland? Nonsense, Parker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But I\\ntook him to the cells where Jim was being attended to by the doctor.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right, Parker,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the man. Well, this will be a\\nfine thing for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter a time, feeling a little exhausted, I went home to try and get\\nsome sleep. The surgeon had attended to my arm, and told me it was but a\\nsuperficial wound. It felt sore enough in spite of that.\\n\\nI had no sooner reached my lodgings than I saw sitting in my easy-chair\\nthe strange man who had called upon me earlier in the evening. He rose\\nto his feet when I entered. I stared at him in utter astonishment.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got him square\\nand fair, I reckon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, with a sigh of complete satisfaction. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\nsatisfied. Yes, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know as how there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aught more I could say. I\\nreckon as how Light Toed Jim an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 me is quits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was determined to find out who this man was this time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit down,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\nsaid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a question or two I must ask you. Just let me get my coat\\noff and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I took my coat off and went over to the bed\\nto lay it down. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I began, and looked around at him. I said no\\nmore, being literally struck dumb. The man was gone!\\n\\nI began to feel uncomfortable. I ran hastily downstairs, only to find\\nthe outer door locked and bolted, as I had left it a few minutes\\nbefore. I went back, utterly nonplussed. For an hour I pondered the\\nmatter over, but could neither make head nor tail of it.\\n\\nWhen I went down to the office next morning I was informed that the\\nburglar wanted to see me. I went to his cell, where he was lying in bed\\nwith his head bandaged. I had hit him pretty hard, as it turned out, and\\nit was probable he would have to lie on the sick list for some days.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d the best of me last night. You hit me\\nrather hard that time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was sorry to have to do it, my man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou would have\\nstabbed me if you could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should. But I say, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor, come a bit closer; I want\\nto ask you a question. How did you know I was on that little job last\\nnight? For, s\\xe2\\x80\\x99elp me, there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a soul knew a breath about it but\\nmyself. I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no pals, never talked to anybody about it, never\\nthought aloud about it, as I knows on. How came you to spot it,\\nguv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no one else in the cell with us, and I thought I might find\\nout something about my mysterious visitor of the night before. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a\\npal of yours who gave me the information,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor. No use telling me that. I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got no\\npals--leastways not in this job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you ever know a man like this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I described my visitor. As I\\nproceeded, Light Toed Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face assumed an expression of real terror.\\nWhatever color there was in it faded away. I never saw a man look more\\nthoroughly frightened. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, eagerly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn course I know\\nwho it is. Why, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Barksea Bill, as I pal\\xe2\\x80\\x99d with at one time--and what\\ndid he say, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor--that he owed me a grudge? That we was quits at\\nlast? Right you are, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cos he did owe me a grudge. I treated Bill very\\nshabby--very shabby, indeed, and he swore solemn he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have his revenge.\\nOn\\xe2\\x80\\x99y, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor, what you see wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Barksea Bill at all, but his ghost,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99cos Barksea Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been dead and buried this three year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was naturally very much exercised in my mind over this weird\\ndevelopment of the affair, and I used to think about it long after Light\\nToed Jim had once more retired to the seclusion of Portland. While he\\nwas in charge at Westford I tried more than once to worm some more\\ninformation out of him about the defunct Barksea Bill, but with no\\nsuccess. He would say no more than that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBill was dead and buried this\\nthree year;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and with that I had to be content. Gradually I came to have\\na firm belief that I had indeed been visited by Barksea Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ghost,\\nand I often told the story to brother officers, and sometimes got well\\nlaughed at. That, however, mattered little to me; I felt sure that any\\nman who had gone through the same experience would have had the same\\nbeliefs.\\n\\nOf course I got my promotion and was soon afterward married. Things went\\nwell with me, and I was lifted from one step to another. In my secret\\nmind I was always sure I owed my first rise to the burglar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ghost, and\\nI should have continued to think so but for an incident which occurred\\njust five years after my capture of Light Toed Jim.\\n\\nI had occasion to travel to Sheffield from Westford, and had to change\\ntrains at Leeds. The carriage I stepped into was occupied by a solitary\\nindividual, who turned his face to me as I sat down. Though dressed in\\nmore respectable fashion, I immediately recognized the man who had\\nvisited me so mysteriously at my lodgings. My first feeling was one of\\nfear, and I daresay my face showed it, for the man laughed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHallo, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see you knew me as soon as you come in.\\nYou owes a deal to me, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor; now, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook here, my man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been taking you for a ghost these\\nfive years past. Now just tell me how you got in and out of my room that\\nnight, will you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe laughed long and loud at that. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA ghost?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if that\\nain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a good un! Why, easy enough, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor. I was a-lodging for a day or\\ntwo in the same house. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy enough, when you know how, to open a\\ndoor very quiet and to slip out, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I followed you sharp, and looked for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor; but you looked down, and I had gone up! You should ha\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ncome up to the attics, and there you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ha\\xe2\\x80\\x99 found me. So you took me for\\na ghost? Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m blowed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI told him what Light Toed Jim had said in the cell.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dessay, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor. You see, \\xe2\\x80\\x99twas this way--it weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nJim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault as I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dead. He tried to murder me, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor, he did,\\nand left me a-lying for dead. So I ses to myself when I comes round that\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d pay him out sooner or later. But after that I quit the profession,\\nJim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nasty conduck havin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 made me sick of it. So I went in for honest\\nwork at my old trade, which was draining and pipe repairing. I was on a\\njob o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that sort in Westford, near Miss Singleton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, when I see\\nLight Toed Jim. I had a hidea what he was up to, havin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heard o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the\\nplate, and I watches him one or two nights, and gets a notion \\xe2\\x80\\x99ow he was\\ngoing to work the job. Then, o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course, you being a officer and close at\\nhand I splits on him--and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you had got the time and details correct?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor. I was an old hand--served many years at\\nPortland, I have, and I knew just how Jim would work it, after seeing\\nhis perlim\\xe2\\x80\\x99nary observations. But a ghost! Ha, ha, ha! Why, guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99nor, you\\nmust ha\\xe2\\x80\\x99 been a very green young officer in them days!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPerhaps I was. At any rate I learned a lesson from the ci-devant Barksea\\nBill--namely, that in searching a house it is always advisable to look\\nup as well as down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA PHANTOM TOE.\\n\\n\\nI am not a superstitious man, far from it, but despite all my efforts to\\nthe contrary I could not help thinking, directly I had taken a survey of\\nmy chamber, that I should never quit it without going through a strange\\nadventure. There was something in its immense size, heaviness and gloom\\nthat seemed to annihilate at one blow all my resolute skepticism as\\nregards supernatural visitations. It appeared to me totally impossible\\nto go into that room and disbelieve in ghosts.\\n\\nThe fact is, I had incautiously partaken at supper of that favorite\\nDutch dish, sauerkraut, and I suppose it had disagreed with me and put\\nstrange fancies into my head. Be this as it may I only know that after\\nparting with my friend for the night I gradually worked myself up into\\nsuch a state of fidgetiness that at last I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure whether I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nbecome a ghost myself.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupposing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ruminated I, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupposing the landlord himself should be a\\npractical robber and should have taken the lock and bolt from off this\\ndoor for the purpose of entering here in the dead of the night,\\nabstracting all my property, and perhaps murdering me! I thought the dog\\nhad a very cutthroat air about him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now, I had never had any such idea\\nuntil that moment, for my host was a fat (all Dutchmen are fat),\\nstupid-looking fellow, who I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe had sense enough to\\nunderstand what a robbery or murder meant, but somehow or other,\\nwhenever we have anything really to annoy us (and it certainly was not\\npleasant to go to bed in a strange place without being able to fasten\\none\\xe2\\x80\\x99s door), we are sure to aggravate it by myriads of chimeras of our\\nown brain.\\n\\nSo, on the present occasion, in the midst of a thousand disagreeable\\nreveries, some of the most wild absurdity, I jumped very gloomily into\\nbed, having first put out my candle (for total darkness was far\\npreferable to its flickering, ghostly light, which transformed rather\\nthan revealed objects), and soon fell asleep, perfectly tired out with\\nmy day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s riding.\\n\\nHow long I lay asleep I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, but I suddenly awoke from a\\ndisagreeable dream of cutthroats, ghosts and long, winding passages in a\\nhaunted inn. An indescribable feeling, such as I never before\\nexperienced, hung upon me. It seemed as if every nerve in my body had a\\nhundred spirits tickling it, and this was accompanied by so great a heat\\nthat, inwardly cursing mine host\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sauerkraut and wondering how the\\nDutchmen could endure such poison, I was forced to sit up in bed to\\ncool myself. The whole of the room was profoundly dark, excepting at one\\nplace, where the moonlight, falling through a crevice in the shutters,\\nthrew a straight line of about an inch or so thick upon the\\nfloor--clear, sharp and intensely brilliant against the darkness. I\\nleave you to conceive my horror when, upon looking at this said line of\\nlight, I saw there a naked human toe--nothing more.\\n\\nFor the first instant I thought the vision must be some effect of\\nmoonlight, then that I was only half awake and could not see distinctly.\\nSo I rubbed my eyes two or three times and looked again. Still there was\\nthe accursed thing--plain, distinct, immovable--marblelike in its\\nfixedness and rigidity, but in everything else horribly human.\\n\\nI am not an easily frightened man. No one who has traveled so much and\\nseen so much and been exposed to so many dangers as I, can be, but there\\nwas something so mysterious and unusual in the appearance of this single\\ntoe that for a short time I could not think what to be at, so I did\\nnothing but stare at it in a state of utter bewilderment.\\n\\nAt length, however, as the toe did not vanish under my steady gaze, I\\nthought I might as well change my tactics, and remembering that all\\nmidnight invaders, be they thieves, ghosts or devils, dislike nothing\\nso much as a good noise I shouted out in a loud voice:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\xe2\\x80\\x99s there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe toe immediately disappeared in the darkness.\\n\\nAlmost simultaneously with my words I leaped out of bed and rushed\\ntoward the place where I had beheld the strange appearance. The next\\ninstant I ran against something and felt an iron grip round my body.\\nAfter this I have no distinct recollection of what occurred, excepting\\nthat a fearful struggle ensued between me and my unseen opponent; that\\nevery now and then we were violently hurled to the floor, from which we\\nalways rose again in an instant, locked in a deadly embrace; that we\\ntugged and strained and pulled and pushed, I in the convulsive and\\nfrantic energy of a fight for life, he (for by this time I had\\ndiscovered that the intruder was a human being) actuated by some passion\\nof which I was ignorant; that we whirled round and round, cheek to cheek\\nand arm to arm, in fierce contest, until the room appeared to whiz round\\nwith us, and that at least a dozen people (my fellow traveler among\\nthem), roused, I suppose, by our repeated falls, came pouring into the\\nroom with lights and showed me struggling with a man having nothing on\\nbut a shirt, whose long, tangled hair and wild, unsettled eyes told me\\nhe was insane. And then, for the first time, I became aware that I had\\nreceived in the conflict several gashes from a knife, which my opponent\\nstill held in his hand.\\n\\nTo conclude my story in a few words (for I daresay all of you by this\\ntime are getting very tired), it turned out that my midnight visitor was\\na madman who was being conveyed to a lunatic asylum at The Hague, and\\nthat he and his keeper had been obliged to stop at Delft on their way.\\nThe poor fellow had contrived during the night to escape from his\\nkeeper, who had carelessly forgotten to lock the door of his chamber,\\nand with that irresistible desire to shed blood peculiar to many insane\\npeople had possessed himself of a pocketknife belonging to the man who\\nhad charge of him, entered my room, which was most likely the only one\\nin the house unfastened, and was probably meditating the fatal stroke\\nwhen I saw his toe in the moonlight, the rest of his body being hidden\\nin the shade.\\n\\nAfter this terrible freak of his he was watched with much greater\\nstrictness, but I ought to observe, as some excuse for the keeper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnegligence, that this was the first act of violence he had ever\\nattempted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMRS. DAVENPORT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S GHOST.\\n\\nBY FREDERICK F. SCHRADER.\\n\\n\\nDear readers, do you agree with Hamlet? Do you believe that there is\\nmore between heaven and earth than we dream of in our philosophy? Does\\nit seem possible to you that Eliphas Levy conjured up the shade of\\nApollonius of Tyana, the prophet of the Magii, in a London hotel, and\\nthat the great sage, William Crookes, drank his tea at breakfast several\\ndays a week, for months in succession, in the society of the\\nmaterialized spirit of a young lady, attired in white linen, with a\\nfeather turban on her head?\\n\\nDo not laugh! Panic would seize you in the presence even of a turbaned\\nspirit, and the grotesque spectacle would but intensify your terror. As\\nfor me, I did not laugh last night on reading an account in a New York\\nnewspaper of a criminal trial that will probably terminate in the death\\npenalty of the accused.\\n\\nIt is a sad case. I shudder as I transcribe the records of the trial\\nfrom the testimony of the hotel waiter, who heard the conversation of\\nthe two confederates through a keyhole, and of forty thoroughly\\ncredible witnesses, who testified to the same facts. What would be my\\nfeelings if I had seen the beautiful victim with the gaping wound in her\\nbreast, into which she dipped her finger to mark the brow of her\\nmurderer?\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\nAbout three o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock on the afternoon of February 3, Professor Davenport\\nand Miss Ida Soutchotte, a very pale and delicate young girl, who had\\nsubmitted to the tests of Professor Davenport for a number of years,\\nwere finishing their dinner in their room in the second story of a New\\nYork hotel. Professor Benjamin Davenport was a celebrity, but it was\\nsaid that he owed his fame to somewhat questionable means. The leading\\nspiritualists did not repose the confidence in him that manifestly\\nmarked their regard for William Crookes or Daniel Douglas Home.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreedy and unscrupulous mediums,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the author of Spiritualism in America\\nthinks, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care to blame for the most bitter attacks to which our cause has\\nbeen exposed. When the materializations do not take place as quickly as\\ncircumstances require, they resort to trickery and fraud to extricate\\nthemselves from a dilemma.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nProfessor Benjamin Davenport belonged to these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cversatile\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mediums.\\nAside from this, queer stories were afloat about him. He was secretly\\naccused of highway robbery in South America, cheating at cards in the\\ngambling houses of San Francisco, and the overhasty use of firearms\\ntoward persons who had never offended him. It was said almost openly,\\nthat the professor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife had died from abuse and grief at his\\ninfidelity. But in spite of these annoying rumors, Mr. Davenport, by\\nvirtue of his skill as a fraud and fakir, continued to exercise a great\\ndeal of influence upon certain plain and simple-minded folks, whom it\\nwas impossible to convince that they had not touched the materialized\\nspirits of their brothers, mothers, or sisters through the agency of his\\nwonderful power. His professional success received material accession\\nfrom his swarthy, Mephisto-like countenance, his deep, fiery eyes, his\\nlarge curved nose, the cynical expression of his mouth, and the lofty,\\nalmost prophetic tone of his words.\\n\\nWhen the waiter had made his last visit--he did not go far--the\\nfollowing conversation took place in the room:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is to be a seance this evening at the residence of Mrs. Harding,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nbegan the medium. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite a number of influential people will be there,\\nand two or three millionaires. Conceal under your skirt the blonde\\nwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wig and the white material in which the spirits usually make\\ntheir appearance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Ida Soutchotte, in a resigned tone.\\n\\nThe waiter heard her pace the room. After a pause, she asked:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhose spirit are you going to control this evening, Benjamin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe waiter heard a loud, brutal laugh and the chair groaning beneath the\\nweight of the demonstrative professor.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow should I know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to conjure up the spirit of my dead wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd another burst of laughter issued from the room, full of sinister\\nlevity. A cry of terror burst from Ida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lips. A muffled sound indicated\\nto the eavesdropper at the door that she was dragging herself to the\\nfeet of the professor.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBenjamin, Benjamin! don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she sobbed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy not? They say I broke Mrs. Davenport\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart. The story is damaging\\nmy reputation, but it will be forgotten if her spirit should address me\\nin terms of endearment from the other shore in the presence of numerous\\nwitnesses. For you will speak to me tenderly, will you not, Ida?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no. You shall not do it; you shall not think of it. Listen to me,\\nfor God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake. During the four years that I have been with you I have\\nobeyed you faithfully and suffered patiently. I have lied and deceived,\\nlike you; I learned to imitate the sleep and symptoms of clairvoyants.\\nTell me, did I ever refuse to serve you, or utter a word of complaint,\\neven when my shoulders bent with the weight of my burden, when you\\npierced the flesh of my arms with knitting needles? Worse than all this,\\nI imitated distant voices behind curtains, and made mothers and wives\\nbelieve that their sons and husbands had come from a better world to\\ncommunicate with them. How often have I performed the most dangerous\\nfeats in parlors with the lamps turned low? Clothed in a shroud or white\\nmuslin I essayed to represent supernatural forms, whom tear-dimmed eyes\\nrecognized as those of departed dear ones. You do not know what I\\nsuffered at this unhallowed work. You scoff at the mysteries of\\neternity. I suffer the torments of an impending retribution. My God! if\\nsome time the dead whom I counterfeit should rise up before me with\\nuplifted arms and dreadful imprecations! This constant terror has\\ninjured my heart--it will kill me. I am consumed by fever. Look how\\nemaciated, how worn-out and downcast I am. But I am under your control.\\nDo as you like with me; I am in your power, and I want it to be so. Have\\nI ever complained? But do not force me to do this thing, Benjamin. Have\\npity on me for what I have done for you in the past, for what I am\\nsuffering. Do not attempt this mummery; do not compel me to play the\\nrole of your dead wife, who was so tender and beautiful. Oh, what put\\nthat thought into your mind? Spare me, Benjamin, I implore you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe professor did not laugh again. Amid the confusion of upturned\\narticles of furniture the eavesdropper distinguished the sound of a\\nskull striking the floor. He concluded that Professor Davenport had\\nknocked Miss Ida down with a blow of his fist, or had kicked her as she\\napproached him. But the waiter did not enter the room, as no one rang\\nfor him.\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nThat evening forty persons were assembled in Mrs. Joanne Harding\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nparlor, staring at the curtain where a spirit form was in process of\\nmaterializing. One dark lantern in a corner of the room contributed the\\nlight that emphasized the darkness rather than relieved it. The room was\\npervaded by profound silence, save the quickened, suppressed breathing\\nof the spectators. The fire in the grate cast mysterious rays of light,\\nresembling fugitive spirits, upon the objects around, almost\\nindistinguishable in the semi-gloom.\\n\\nProfessor Davenport was at his best this evening. The spirit world\\nobeyed him without hesitation, like their lawful master. He was the\\nmighty prince of souls. Hands that had no arms were seen picking flowers\\nfrom the vases; the touch of an invisible spirit conjured sweet\\nmelodies from the keys of the piano; the furniture responded by\\nintelligent rappings to the most unanticipated questions. The professor\\nhimself elevated his form in symbolical distortions from the floor to an\\naltitude of three feet, indicated by Mrs. Harding, and remained\\nsuspended in the air for a quarter of an hour, holding live coals in his\\nhands.\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nBut the most interesting, as well as the most conclusive, test was to be\\nthe materialization of the spirit of Mrs. Arabella Davenport, which the\\nprofessor had promised at the beginning of the seance.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe hour has come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the medium.\\n\\nAnd while the hearts of all throbbed with anxious suspense, and their\\neyes distended with painful expectancy of the promised materialization,\\nBenjamin Davenport stood before the curtain. In the twilight the tall\\nman with the disheveled hair and demon look, was really terrible and\\nhandsome.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAppear, Arabella!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, in a commanding voice, with gestures\\nof the Nazarene at the sepulcher of Lazarus.\\n\\nAll are waiting----\\n\\nSuddenly a cry burst from behind the curtain--a piercing, shuddering,\\nhorrible shriek, the shriek of an expiring soul.\\n\\nThe spectators trembled. Mrs. Harding almost fainted. The medium\\nhimself appeared surprised.\\n\\nBut Benjamin recovered his composure on seeing the curtain move and\\nadmit the spirit.\\n\\nThe apparition was that of a young woman with long blonde tresses; she\\nwas beautiful and pale, clad in some light, whitish material. Her breast\\nwas bare, and on the left side appeared a bleeding wound, in which\\ntrembled a knife.\\n\\nThe spectators arose and retreated, pushing their chairs to the wall.\\nThose who chanced to look at the medium noticed that a deathly pallor\\nhad overspread his face, and that he was cowering and trembling.\\n\\nBut the young woman, Mrs. Arabella, the real one, whom he so well\\nremembered, she had come in response to his summons, and advanced in a\\ndirect line toward Benjamin, who in terror covered his eyes to shut out\\nthe ghastly sight, and with a cry fled behind the furniture. But she\\ndipped the finger of her thin hand into the blood from her wound and\\ntraced it across the brow of the unconscious medium, the while\\nrepeating, in a slow, monotonous tone that sounded like the echo of a\\nwail, again and again:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are my murderer! You are my murderer!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd while he was rolling and tossing in deadly terror on the floor they\\nturned up the lights.\\n\\nThe spirit had vanished. But in the communicating room, behind the\\ncurtain, they found the body of poor Miss Ida Soutchotte with horribly\\ndistorted features. A physician who was present pronounced it heart\\nstroke.\\n\\nAnd that is the reason that Prof. Benjamin Davenport appeared alone in a\\nNew York courtroom to answer to the charge of having murdered his wife\\nfour years ago in San Francisco.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PHANTOM WOMAN.\\n\\n\\nHe took an all-possessing, burning fancy to her from the first. She was\\nneither young nor pretty, so far as he could see--but she was wrapped\\nround with mystery. That was the key of it all; she was noticeable in\\nspite of herself. Her face at the window, sunset after sunset; her eyes,\\ngazing out mournfully through the dusty panes, hypnotized the lawyer. He\\nsaw her through the twilight night after night, and he grew at length to\\nwait through the days in a feverish waiting for dusk, and that one look\\nat an unknown woman.\\n\\nShe was always at the same window on the ground floor, sitting doing\\nnothing. She looked beyond, so the infatuated solicitor fancied, at him.\\nOnce he even thought that he detected the ghost of a friendly smile on\\nher lips. Their eyes always met with a mute desire to make acquaintance.\\nThis romance went on for a couple of months.\\n\\nGilbert Dent assured himself that nothing in this life can possibly\\nremain stationary, and he cudgeled his brain for a respectable manner of\\nintroducing himself to his idol.\\n\\nHe had hardly arrived at this point when he received a shock. There came\\nan evening when she was not at the window.\\n\\nNext morning he walked down Wood Lane on his way to the office. He\\nalways went by train, but he felt a strong disinclination to go through\\nanother day without a sight of her. His heart began to beat like a\\nschoolgirl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as he drew near the house. If she should be at the window.\\nHe was almost disposed to take his courage in his hand and call on her,\\nand--yes, even--tell her in a quick burst that she had mysteriously\\nbecome all the world to him. He could see nothing ridiculous in this\\ncourse; the possibility of her being married, or having family ties of\\nany sort, had simply never occurred to him.\\n\\nHowever, she was not at the window; what was more, there was a sinister\\nsilence, a sort of breathlessness about the whole place.\\n\\nIt was a very hot morning in late August. He looked a long time, but no\\nface came, and no movement stirred the house.\\n\\nHe went his way, walking like a man who has been heavily knocked on the\\nbrow and sees stars still. That afternoon he left the office early, and\\nin less than an hour stood at the gate again. The window was blank. He\\npushed the gate back--it hung on one hinge--and walked up the drive to\\nthe door. There were five steps--five steps leading up to it. At the\\nfoot he wheeled aside sharply to the window; he had a sick dread of\\nlooking through the small panes--why he could not have told.\\n\\nWhen at last he found courage to look he saw that there was a small\\nround table set just under the window--a work-table to all appearance;\\none of those things with lots of little compartments all round and a lid\\nin the middle which shut over a well-like cavity for holding pieces of\\nneedlework. He remembered that his mother had one--thirty years before.\\n\\nRound the edge of the table was gripped a small, delicate hand. Gilbert\\nDent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes ran from this bloodless hand and slim wrist to a shoulder\\nunder a coarse stuff bodice--to a rather wasted throat, which was bare\\nand flung back.\\n\\nSo this was the end--before the beginning. He saw her. She was dead;\\ntwisted on the floor with a ghastly face turned up toward the ceiling,\\nand stiff fingers caught in desperation round the work table.\\n\\nHe stumbled away along the path and into the lane.\\n\\nFor a long time he could not realize the horror of this thing. The\\ninfluence of the decayed house hung over him--nothing seemed real. It\\nwas quite dark when he moved away from the gate, and went in the\\ndirection of the nearest police station. That she was dead--this woman\\nwhose very name he did not know although she influenced him so\\npowerfully--he was certain; one look at the face would have told anyone\\nthat. That she was murdered he more than suspected. He had seen no blood\\nabout; there had been no mark on the long, bare throat, and yet the word\\nrushed in his ears, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMurder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLater on he went back with a police officer.\\n\\nThey broke into the house and entered the room. It was in utter\\ndarkness, of course, by now. Dent, his fingers trembling, struck a\\nmatch. It flared round the walls and lighted them for a moment before he\\nlet it fall on the dusty floor.\\n\\nThe policeman began to light his lantern and turned it stolidly on the\\nwindow. He had no reason for delay; he was eager to get to the bottom of\\nthe business. His professional zeal was whetted; this promised to be a\\nmystery with a spice in it.\\n\\nHe turned the light full on the window; he gave a strange, choked cry,\\nhalf of rage, half of apprehension. Then he went up to Gilbert Dent, who\\nstood in the middle of the room with his hands before his eyes, and took\\nhis shoulder and shook it none too gently.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t nobody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nDent looked wildly at the window--the recess was empty except for the\\nwork-table. The woman was gone.\\n\\nThey searched the house; they minutely inspected the garden. Everything\\nwas normal; everything told the same mournful tale--of desertion, of\\ndeath, of long empty years. But they found no woman, nor trace of one.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis house,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the policeman, looking suspiciously into the lawyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nface, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas been empty for longer than I can remember. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll live in\\nit. They do say something about foul play a good many years ago. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nknow about that. All I do know is that the landlord can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it off his\\nhands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was doubtful if Gilbert Dent heard one word of what the man was\\nsaying. He was too stunned to do anything but creep home--when he was\\nallowed to go--and let himself stealthily into his own house with a\\nlatch key; he was afraid even of himself. He did not go to bed that\\nnight.\\n\\nAs for the mystery of the woman, the matter was allowed to drop; it\\nended--officially. There was a shrug and a grin at the police station.\\nThe impression there was that the lawyer had been drinking--that the\\ndead woman in the empty room was a gruesome freak of his tipsy brain.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA week or so later Dent called on his brother Ned--the one near relation\\nhe had. Ned was a doctor; perhaps he was a shade more matter-of-fact\\nthan Gilbert; at all events, when the latter told his story of the house\\nand the woman, he attributed the affair solely to liver.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are overworked\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--the elder brother looked at the younger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yellow\\nface. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn experience of this nature is by no means uncommon. Haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\nheard of people having their pet \\xe2\\x80\\x98spooks\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut this was a real woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he declared. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI--I, well, I was in love\\nwith her. I had made up my mind to marry her--if I could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNed gave him a keen, swift glance.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go to Brighton to-morrow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, with quiet decision. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs for\\nyour work, everything must be put aside. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve run completely down. You\\nought to have been taken in hand before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey went to Brighton, and it really seemed as if Ned was right, and\\nthat the woman at the window had been merely a nervous creation. It\\nseemed so, that is, for nearly three weeks, and then the climax came.\\n\\nIt was in the twilight--she had always been part of it--that Gilbert\\nDent saw her again; the woman that he had found lying dead.\\n\\nThey were walking, the two brothers, along the cliffs.\\n\\nThe wind was blowing in their faces, the sea was booming beneath the\\ncliff. Ned had just said it was about time they turned back to the hotel\\nand had some dinner, when Gilbert with a cry leapt forward to the very\\nedge of the flat grass path on which they were strolling. The movement\\nwas so sudden that his brother barely caught him in time. They\\nstruggled and swayed on the very edge of the cliff for a second;\\nGilbert, possessed by some sudden frenzy, seemed resolved to go over,\\nbut the other at last dragged him backward, and they rolled together on\\nthe close, thick turf.\\n\\nAt this point Gilbert opened his eyes and tried to get on his feet.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked his brother, cheerfully, holding out a helping hand.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrange! The sea has that effect on some people. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that you\\nwere one of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat effect?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVertigo, my dear fellow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the other solemnly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw her. It is not worth your while\\nto try to account for anything. I have been inclined to think that you\\nwere right--that she, the woman at the window, was a fancy, that I had\\nfallen in love with a creation of my own brain; but I saw her again\\nto-night. You must have seen her yourself--she was within a couple of\\nfeet of you. Why did you not try and save her? It was nothing short of\\nmurder to let her go over like that. I did my best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou certainly did--to kill us both,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ned, grimly.\\n\\nGilbert gave him a wild look.\\n\\nAfter luncheon Ned persuaded him to rest--watched him fall asleep, and\\nthen went out.\\n\\nIn the porch of the hotel he was met by a waiter on his return who told\\nhim that Gilbert had left about a quarter of an hour after he had\\nhimself gone out.\\n\\nDirectly he heard this he feared the worst; having, as is usual in such\\ncases, a very hazy idea of what the worst might be. Of course he must\\nfollow without a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delay; but a reference to the time-table told\\nhim that there was not another train for an hour, and that was slow.\\n\\nIt was already getting dusk when he arrived there. He felt certain that\\nGilbert would go there. He got to the end of the lane and walked up it\\nslowly, examining every house. There would be no difficulty in\\nrecognizing the one he wanted; Gilbert had described it in detail more\\nthan once.\\n\\nHe stood outside the loosely hanging gate at last, and stared through\\nthe darkness at the shabby stucco front and rank garden.\\n\\nHe went down a flight of steps to the back door, and finding it\\nunfastened, stepped into a stone passage. It was one of the problems of\\nthe place that he should have avoided the main entrance door with a\\nhalf-admitted dread, and that, only half admitting still, he was afraid\\nto mount the long flight of stone stairs leading from the servants\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nquarters. However, he pulled himself together and went up to the room.\\n\\nIt was quite dark inside. He heard something scuttle across the floor;\\nhe felt the grit and dust of years under his feet. He struck a\\nmatch--just as Gilbert had done--and looked first at the recess in which\\nthe window was built. The match flared round the room for a moment and\\ngave him a flash picture of his surroundings. He saw the stripes of\\ngaudy paper moving almost imperceptibly, like tentacles of some sea\\nmonster, from the wall; he saw a creature--it looked like a rat--scurry\\nacross the floor from the window to the great mantelpiece of hard white\\nmarble.\\n\\nIf he had seen nothing more than this.\\n\\nHe saw in detail all that the first match had flashed at him. He saw his\\nbrother lying on the floor; a ghastly coincidence, his hand was caught\\nround the edge of the work-table as hers had been. The other hand was\\nclenched across his breast; there was a look of great agony on his face.\\n\\nA dead face, of course. This was the end of the affair. He was lying\\ndead by the window where the woman had sat every night at dusk and\\nsmiled at him.\\n\\nThe second match went out; the brother of the dead man struck a third.\\nHe looked again and closely. Then he staggered to his feet and gave a\\ncry. It rang through the empty rooms and echoed without wearying down\\nthe long, stone passages in the basement.\\n\\nGilbert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head was thrown back; his chin peaked to the ceiling. On his\\nthroat were livid marks. The doctor saw them distinctly; he saw the grip\\nof small fingers; the distinct impression of a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little hand.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe curious thing about the whole story--the most curious thing,\\nperhaps--is that no other eye ever saw those murderous marks. So there\\nwas no scandal, no chase after the murderer, no undiscovered crime. They\\nfaded; when the doctor saw his brother again in the full light and in\\nthe presence of others his throat was clear. And the post mortem proved\\nthat death was due to natural causes.\\n\\nSo the matter stands, and will.\\n\\nBut where the house and its overgrown garden stood runs a new road with\\nneat red and white villas.\\n\\nWhatever secret it knew--if any--it kept discreetly.\\n\\nNed Dent is morbid enough to go down the smart new road in the twilight\\nsometimes and wonder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PHANTOM HAG.\\n\\n\\nThe other evening in an old castle the conversation turned upon\\napparitions, each one of the party telling a story. As the accounts grew\\nmore horrible the young ladies drew closer together.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you ever had an adventure with a ghost?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said they to me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you\\nnot know a story to make us shiver? Come, tell us something.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am quite willing to do so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will tell you of an\\nincident that happened to myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nToward the close of the autumn of 1858 I visited one of my friends,\\nsub-prefect of a little city in the center of France. Albert was an old\\ncompanion of my youth, and I had been present at his wedding. His\\ncharming wife was full of goodness and grace. My friend wished to show\\nme his happy home, and to introduce me to his two pretty little\\ndaughters. I was feted and taken great care of. Three days after my\\narrival I knew the entire city, curiosities, old castles, ruins, etc.\\nEvery day about four o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock Albert would order the phaeton, and we\\nwould take a long ride, returning home in the evening. One evening my\\nfriend said to me:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo-morrow we will go further than usual. I want to take you to the\\nBlack Rocks. They are curious old Druidical stones, on a wild and\\ndesolate plain. They will interest you. My wife has not seen them yet,\\nso we will take her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe following day we drove out at the usual hour. Albert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife sat by\\nhis side. I occupied the back seat alone. The weather was gray and\\nsomber that afternoon, and the journey was not very pleasant. When we\\narrived at the Black Rocks the sun was setting. We got out of the\\nphaeton, and Albert took care of the horses.\\n\\nWe walked some little distance through the fields before reaching the\\ngiant remains of the old Druid religion. Albert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife wished to climb\\nto the summit of the altar, and I assisted her. I can still see her\\ngraceful figure as she stood draped in a red shawl, her veil floating\\naround her.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow beautiful it is! But does it not make you feel a little\\nmelancholy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, extending her hand toward the dark horizon, which\\nwas lighted a little by the last rays of the sun.\\n\\nThe afternoon wind blew violently, and sighed through the stunted trees\\nthat grew around the stone cromlechs; not a dwelling nor a human being\\nwas in sight. We hastened to get down, and silently retraced our steps\\nto the carriage.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must hurry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Albert; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe sky is threatening, and we shall have\\nscarcely time to reach home before night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe carefully wrapped the robes around his wife. She tied the veil around\\nher face, and the horses started into a rapid trot. It was growing dark;\\nthe scenery around us was bare and desolate; clumps of fir trees here\\nand there and furze bushes formed the only vegetation. We began to feel\\nthe cold, for the wind blew with fury; the only sound we heard was the\\nsteady trot of the horses and the sharp clear tinkle of their bells.\\n\\nSuddenly I felt the heavy grasp of a hand upon my shoulder. I turned my\\nhead quickly. A horrible apparition presented itself before my eyes. In\\nthe empty place at my side sat a hideous woman. I tried to cry out; the\\nphantom placed her fingers upon her lips to impose silence upon me. I\\ncould not utter a sound. The woman was clothed in white linen; her head\\nwas cowled; her face was overspread with a corpse-like pallor, and in\\nplace of eyes were ghastly black cavities.\\n\\nI sat motionless, overcome by terror.\\n\\nThe ghost suddenly stood up and leaned over the young wife. She\\nencircled her with her arms, and lowered her hideous head as if to kiss\\nher forehead.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a wind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Madame Albert, turning precipitately toward me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy\\nveil is torn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs she turned I felt the same infernal pressure on my shoulder, and the\\nplace occupied by the phantom was empty. I looked out to the right and\\nleft--the road was deserted, not an object in sight.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a dreadful gale!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Madame Albert. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you feel it? I cannot\\nexplain the terror that seized me; my veil was torn by the wind as if by\\nan invisible hand; I am trembling still.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Albert, smiling; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwrap yourself up, my dear; we will\\nsoon be warming ourselves by a good fire at home. I am starving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA cold perspiration covered my forehead; a shiver ran through me; my\\ntongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and I could not articulate a\\nsound; a sharp pain in my shoulder was the only sensible evidence that I\\nwas not the victim of an hallucination. Putting my hand upon my aching\\nshoulder, I felt a rent in the cloak that was wrapped around me. I\\nlooked at it; five perfectly distinct holes--visible traces of the grip\\nof the horrible phantom. I thought for a moment that I should die or\\nthat my reason should leave me; it was, I think, the most dreadful\\nmoment of my life.\\n\\nFinally I became more calm; this nameless agony had lasted for some\\nminutes; I do not think it is possible for a human being to suffer more\\nthan I did during that time. As soon as I had recovered my senses, I\\nthought at first I would tell my friends all that had passed, but\\nhesitated, and finally did not, fearing that my story would frighten\\nMadame Albert, and feeling sure my friend would not believe me. The\\nlights of the little city revived me, and gradually the oppression of\\nterror that overwhelmed me became lighter.\\n\\nSo soon as we reached home, Madame Albert untied her veil; it was\\nliterally in shreds. I hoped to find my clothes whole and prove to\\nmyself that it was all imagination. But no, the cloth was torn in five\\nplaces, just where the fingers had seized my shoulder. There was no\\nmark, however, upon my flesh, only a dull pain.\\n\\nI returned to Paris the next day, where I endeavored to forget the\\nstrange adventure; or at least when I thought of it, I would force\\nmyself to think it an hallucination.\\n\\nThe day after my return I received a letter from my friend Albert. It\\nwas edged with black. I opened it with a vague fear.\\n\\nHis wife had died the day of my return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM THE TOMB.\\n\\nTRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF DE MAUPASSANT BY E. C. WAGGENER.\\n\\n\\nThe guests filed slowly into the hotel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great dining-hall and took\\ntheir places, the waiters began to serve them leisurely, to give the\\ntardy ones time to arrive and to save themselves the bother of bringing\\nback the courses; and the old bathers, the yearly habitues, with whom\\nthe season was far advanced, kept a close watch on the door each time it\\nopened, hoping for the coming of new faces.\\n\\nNew faces! the single distraction of all pleasure resorts. We go to\\ndinner chiefly to canvass the daily arrivals, to wonder who they are,\\nwhat they do and what they think. A restless desire seems to have taken\\npossession of us, a longing for pleasant adventures, for friendly\\nacquaintances, perhaps, for possible lovers. In this elbow-to-elbow life\\nour unknown neighbors become of paramount importance. Curiosity is\\npiqued, sympathy on the alert and the social instinct doubly active.\\n\\nWe have hatreds for a week, friendships for a month, and view all men\\nwith the special eyes of watering-place intimacy. Sometimes during an\\nhour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chat after dinner, under the trees of the park, where ripples a\\nhealing spring, we discover men of superior intellect and surprising\\nmerit, and a month later have wholly forgotten these new friends, so\\ncharming at first sight.\\n\\nThere, too, more specially than elsewhere, serious and lasting ties are\\nformed. We see each other every day, we learn to know each other very\\nsoon, and in the affection that springs up so rapidly between us there\\nis mingled much of the sweet abandon of old and tried intimates. And\\nlater on, how tender are the memories cherished of the first hours of\\nthis friendship, of the first communion in which the soul came to light,\\nof the first glances that questioned and responded to the secret\\nthoughts and interrogatories the lips have not dared yet to utter, of\\nthe first cordial confidence and delicious sensation of opening one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nheart to someone who has seemed to lay bare to you his own! The very\\ndullness of the hours, as it were, the monotony of days all alike, but\\nrenders more complete the rapid budding and blooming of friendship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nflower.\\n\\nThat evening, then, as on every evening, we awaited the appearance of\\nunfamiliar faces.\\n\\nThere came only two, but very peculiar ones, those of a man and a\\nwoman--father and daughter. They seemed to have stepped from the pages\\nof some weird legend; and yet there was an attraction about them, albeit\\nan unpleasant one, that made me set them down at once as the victims of\\nsome fatality.\\n\\nThe father was tall, spare, a little bent, with hair blanched white; too\\nwhite for his still young countenance, and in his manner and about his\\nperson the sedate austerity of carriage that bespeaks the Puritan. The\\ndaughter was, possibly, some twenty-four or twenty-five years of age.\\nShe was very slight, emaciated, her exceedingly pale countenance bearing\\na languid, spiritless expression; one of those people whom we sometimes\\nencounter, apparently too weak for the cares and tasks of life, too\\nfeeble to move or do the things that we must do every day. Nevertheless\\nthe girl was pretty, with the ethereal beauty of an apparition. It was\\nshe, undoubtedly, who came for the benefit of the waters.\\n\\nThey chanced to be placed at table immediately opposite to me; and I was\\nnot long in noticing that the father, too, had a strange affection,\\nsomething wrong about the nerves it seemed. Whenever he was going to\\nreach for anything, his hand, with a jerky twitch, described a sort of\\nfluttering zig-zag, before he was able to grasp what he was after. Soon,\\nthe motion disturbed me so much, I kept my head turned in order not to\\nsee it. But not before I had also observed that the young girl kept her\\nglove on her left hand while she ate.\\n\\nDinner ended, I went out as usual for a turn in the grounds belonging to\\nthe establishment. A sort of park, I might say, stretching clear to the\\nlittle station of Auvergne, Chatel-Guyon, nestling in a gorge at the\\nfoot of the high mountain, from which flowed the sparkling, bubbling\\nsprings, hot from the furnace of an ancient volcano. Beyond us there,\\nthe domes, small extinct craters--of which Chatel-Guyon is the starting\\npoint--raised their serrated heads above the long chain; while beyond\\nthe domes came two distinct regions, one of them, needle-like peaks, the\\nother of bold, precipitous mountains.\\n\\nIt was very warm that evening, and I contented myself with pacing to and\\nfro under the rustling trees, gazing at the mountains and listening to\\nthe strains of the band, pouring from the Casino, situated on a knoll\\nthat overlooked the grounds.\\n\\nPresently, I perceived the father and daughter coming toward me with\\nslow steps. I bowed to them in that pleasant Continental fashion with\\nwhich one always salutes his hotel companions. The gentleman halted at\\nonce.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPardon me, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut may I ask if you can direct us to a\\nshort walk, easy and pretty, if possible?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I answered, and offered to lead them myself to the valley\\nthrough which the swift river flows--a deep, narrow cleft between two\\ngreat declivities, rocky and wooded.\\n\\nThey accepted, and as we walked, we naturally discussed the virtue of\\nthe mineral waters. They had, as I had surmised, come there on his\\ndaughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has a strange malady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe seat of which her physicians\\ncannot determine. She suffers from the most inexplicable nervous\\nsymptoms. Sometimes they declare her ill of a heart disease; sometimes\\nof a liver complaint; again of a spinal trouble. At present they\\nattribute it to the stomach--that great motor and regulator of the\\nbody--this Protean disease of a thousand forms, a thousand modes of\\nattack. It is why we are here. I, myself, think it is her nerves. In any\\ncase it is sad.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis reminded me of his own jerking hand.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may be hereditary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour own nerves are a little disturbed,\\nare they not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, tranquilly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all, I have always possessed\\nthe calmest nerves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then, suddenly, as if bethinking himself:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d touching his hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis not nerves, but the result of a\\nshock, a terrible shock that I suffered once. Fancy it, sir, this child\\nof mine has been buried alive!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could find nothing to say, I was dumb with surprise.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburied alive; but hear the story, it is not long.\\nFor some time past Juliette had seemed affected with a disordered action\\nof the heart. We were finally certain that the trouble was organic and\\nfeared the worst. One day it came, she was brought in lifeless--dead.\\nShe had fallen dead while walking in the garden. Physicians came in\\nhaste, but nothing could be done. She was gone. For two days and nights\\nI watched beside her myself, and with my own hands placed her in her\\ncoffin, which I followed to the cemetery and saw placed in the family\\nvault. This was in the country, in the province of Lorraine.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt had been my wish, too, that she should be buried in her jewels,\\nbracelets, necklace and rings, all presents that I had given her, and in\\nher first ball dress. You can imagine, sir, the state of my heart in\\nreturning home. She was all that I had left, my wife had been dead for\\nmany years. I returned, in truth, half mad, shut myself alone in my room\\nand fell into my chair dazed, unable to move, merely a miserable,\\nbreathing wreck.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoon my old valet, Prosper, who had helped me place Juliette in her\\ncoffin and lay her away for her last sleep, came in noiselessly to see\\nif he could not induce me to eat. I shook my head, answering nothing. He\\npersisted:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Monsieur is wrong; this will make him ill. Will monsieur allow me,\\nthen, to put him to bed?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let me alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe yielded and withdrew.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow many hours passed I do not know. What a night! What a night! It was\\nvery cold; my fire of logs had long since burned out in the great\\nfireplace; and the wind, a wintry blast, charged with an icy frost,\\nhowled and screamed about the house and strained at my windows with a\\ncuriously sinister sound.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLong hours, I say, rolled by. I sat still where I had fallen,\\nprostrated, overwhelmed; my eyes wide open, but my body strengthless,\\ndead; my soul drowned in despair. Suddenly the great bell gave a loud\\npeal.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gave such a leap that my chair cracked under me. The slow, solemn\\nsound rang through the empty house. I looked at the clock.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was two in the morning. Who could be coming at such an hour?\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwice again the bell pulled sharply. The servants would never answer,\\nperhaps never hear it. I took up a candle and made my way to the door. I\\nwas about to demand:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Who is there?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but, ashamed of the weakness, nerved myself and drew\\nback the bolts. My heart throbbed, my pulse beat, I threw back the panel\\nbrusquely and there, in the darkness, saw a shape like a phantom,\\ndressed in white.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI recoiled, speechless with anguish, stammering:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Who--who are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA voice answered:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98It is I, father.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was my child, Juliette.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTruly, I thought myself mad. I shuddered, shrinking backward before the\\nspecter as it advanced, gesticulating with my hand to ward off the\\napparition. It is that gesture which has never left me.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgain the phantom spoke:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Father, father! See, I am not dead. Someone came to rob me of my\\njewels--they cut off my finger--the--the flowing blood revived me.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I saw then that she was covered with blood. I fell to my knees\\npanting, sobbing, laughing, all in one. As soon as I regained my senses,\\nbut still so bewildered I scarcely comprehended the happiness that had\\ncome to me, I took her in my arms, carried her to her room, and rang\\nfrantically for Prosper to rekindle the fire, bring a warm drink for\\nher, and go for the doctor.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe came running, entered, gazed a moment at my daughter in the\\nchair--gave a gasp of fright and horror and fell back--dead.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was he who had opened the vault, who had wounded and robbed my\\nchild, and then abandoned her; for he could not efface all trace of his\\ndeed; and he had not even taken the trouble to return the coffin to its\\nniche; sure, besides, of not being suspected by me, who trusted him so\\nfully. We are truly very unfortunate people, monsieur.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe was silent.\\n\\nMeanwhile the night had come on, enveloping in the gloom the still and\\nsolitary little valley; a sort of mysterious dread seemed to fall upon\\nme in presence of these strange beings--this corpse come to life, and\\nthis father with his painful gestures.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us return,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe night has grown chill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd still in silence, we retraced our steps back to the hotel, and I\\nshortly afterward returned to the city. I lost all further knowledge of\\nthe two peculiar visitors to my favorite summer resort.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSANDY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S GHOST.\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Commerdations fer the night, stranger? Waal, yes; I reckon we can fix\\na place fer you. Hev a cheer an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 set you down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you find this rather a lonely place--no neighbors, no\\nnothing, that I can see? How came you to settle here, so far removed\\nfrom other habitations?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWaal, perhaps it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best not ter ask too many questions ter once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeg your pardon. No offense was intended, I assure you. Simply idle\\ncuriosity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say \\xe2\\x80\\x99nuther word, stranger, but come in an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hev a snack fer\\nsupper. Polly, bring on the victu\\xe2\\x80\\x99ls. Yer jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPolly at once obeyed. She was a typical Western girl--tall, lithe,\\ngraceful and limpid-eyed. She was clear-skinned and high-spirited, too,\\nand in this case ignorant through no fault of her own. John Barr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes\\nscanned her intently, and a flush came to her cheeks. For the first time\\nin her life she was unpleasantly conscious of her bare feet. It may have\\nbeen this that made her stumble and spill some of the contents of an\\nearthen bowl over the guest\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knees as she placed it on the table.\\n\\nHer eyes flashed and a tear of anger twinkled on the lashes. She\\nstopped, half meaning to apologize, but an oath from her father caused\\nher to set the bowl down heavily and to hurry from the cabin. A moment\\nlater Barr saw a flutter of pink calico from behind a pile of rocks. Old\\nKit Robinson saw it, too.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wonder at yer sayin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x99tain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t right. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sma\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gal, and a good\\nlooker, too, as should hev been sent away frum here ter school ter be\\neddicated. But she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave her no \\xe2\\x80\\x99count dad. I orter be shot fer\\ncussin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 her. But I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t what I use ter be. Settin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 here an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 keepin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nguard makes me narvous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBarr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes asked the question his lips refused to speak. Supper eaten,\\nthe men went outside and sat with their chairs tilted back against the\\ncabin. Something in the younger man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frank face had softened old Kit\\ninto a reminiscent mood and made him strangely inclined to gratify an\\nidle curiosity.\\n\\nThe soft evening winds sighed through the branches of the tall spruce\\npines, and the declining rays of the setting sun caused the shadow of\\nthe rude home to stretch out longer across the greensward. From its\\nshelter where he sat John Barr looked out on the grand ranges of the\\nRockies and wondered where in their vastness he would find the man he\\nsought--the finding of whom had brought him out into this wild and\\nalmost forsaken mining camp.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStranger, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve took a likin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ter you. Ye\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve a sumthin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about you thet\\nreminds me of sum one I know, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you look like an honest chap. Say, do\\nyou b\\xe2\\x80\\x99lieve in ghosts?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe put the question very suddenly, and a look of disappointment crossed\\nhis face when Barr told him that he did not believe in spooks.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWaal, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen \\xe2\\x80\\x99em!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA thought connecting the pink calico with something in the past came to\\nBarr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you tell me about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like ter if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll sw\\xe2\\x80\\x99ar, on yer derringer, never ter blab. Will\\nyou sw\\xe2\\x80\\x99ar?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe solitary guest started to smile, but the smile faded at the thought\\nof unshed tears in Polly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes. It might make it easier for her if he\\nhumored the old man.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll swear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. And he did.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you see yan old spruce at the turn of the trail an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the cliff jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nabove? Waal, thet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the spot I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 guardin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 till the owner\\ncums ter claim it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m quick ter burn powder an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a pretty sure shot. I\\nknow a man when I sees him, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t easy fooled. Waal, ter begin\\nwith, I had a pardner once, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he wuz a man, sure \\xe2\\x80\\x99nough. He wuz frum\\nthe State of New York. I never axed him as ter how so fine a gent cum\\nter be diggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shov\\xe2\\x80\\x99lin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the Rockies, though ter myself I said\\nthar wuz sum good reason. He had light hair, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we called him Sandy,\\nfer short, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he wuz jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 erbout as gritty as sand. We wuz as unlike as\\nany two fellers you ever saw. He wuz quietlike an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 steady, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I wuz\\nsorter wild an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reckless an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 liked mounting dew mos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 too well. Waal,\\nwhen we had a little dust scraped together, we would divvy, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I tuk my\\nshare way down ter the station on the other side of the cliffs an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sent\\nit off ter the bank in Helena. But I allers left sum hid whar the gal\\nwould find it. Old Sandy hed a bank of his own thet no one knew erbout,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x99cepting hisself, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ev\\xe2\\x80\\x99ry time we divided he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d carry part of it ter\\nhis hidin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 place, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then give the rest ter me ter send ter his boy,\\nthet he said wuz bein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 eddicated in sum college way up in Boston. He\\nseemed ter think a heap of thet boy. Arter awhile my old woman give out,\\nan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 soon we laid her away on the hillside. It wuz hard, stranger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOld Kit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice failed him for a moment, but he quickly regained his\\ncomposure and continued:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut when old Sandy, my good old pard, give up I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keer fer\\nnothin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. We buried him in style. All the boys frum round the diggin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nwuz thar, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 many an eye wuz wet. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hev nary a preacher, but\\nthe gal she prayed at the grave. Fer the life of me I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where\\nshe larnt it. Reckon the old woman must hev told her. Next mornin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the\\ngal showed me a letter thet Sandy give her jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 afore he died. It wuz\\nter his boy, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she wuz ter give it ter him if he ever cum out this\\nway, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got it yet.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThet same evenin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 after supper, feelin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 kinder glumish an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 like thar\\nwuz sumthin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in my throat I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t swaller, I tuk a stroll up the\\ngulch. I went on out ter the top of the edge of the big rock an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 got ter\\nstudyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 whar I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d find another pard like Sandy. All ter once I felt a\\nhand touch my shoulder kinder light once or twice. I jumped up, half\\nexpectin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it wuz Sandy, but it wuz only the gal. Waal, I wuz all tuk\\nback at fust, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then I got mad.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98What air you doin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up here?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I axed, kinder rough. She hed tears in\\nher eyes as she looked at me, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Pap, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t git mad. I wuz lonesum. I seed you cumin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up this way, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nI follered you, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause I wanted ter tell you thet Sandy said ter give\\nhis boy his pile when he cums.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Waal,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 says I, \\xe2\\x80\\x98you might hev waited till I cum back ter the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nAn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then I sent her back.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cArter she wuz gone I sot ter studyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 whar in the world Sandy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pile\\nwuz. I tried ter think whar could he hev hid it. But it warn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no use.\\nAll ter once I noticed it wuz plum dark, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as these mountings ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99lthy place fer a man ter roam in arter nightfall, especially if he\\nain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got his shootin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 irons on, I cut a pretty swift gait fer the\\nshack.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as I cum round the bend thar at the pine I happened ter look up\\nterward the clift, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thar sot Sandy. Yes, sir. It wuz him sure as yer\\nborn. My feet felt heavy as lead, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move frum the spot. I\\ntried ter holler, but it warn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no go. Finally I gave a sudden jerk an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nmade a step terward him, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as I did so he disappeared. Then I made\\ntracks fer home. But I kept mum, \\xe2\\x80\\x99cause I knowed the boys would say thet\\nmounting dew wuz lickin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 up my brains, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I would be seein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 snakes an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nsich things afore long.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe next night sumhow er \\xe2\\x80\\x99nuther I thought ter go an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 see if he wuz\\nthar ag\\xe2\\x80\\x99in, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sure \\xe2\\x80\\x99nough, thar he sot, lookin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 kinder sad an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 making\\nmarks on the rocks with his fingers. I hed my hand on my gun this time,\\nso I got a little closter than afore. But, by hookey, he got away from\\nme ag\\xe2\\x80\\x99in, nor did he cum back.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could hardly wait fer the next night ter cum round. At the same time\\nI wuz on hand good an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 early, jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as it begun ter git dark, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the\\ntrees looked like long spooks a-stretchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 out their arms. I looked\\nterward the clift, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thar he sot a-markin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a-scratchin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on the\\nrock with his fingers an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 still looking sad. Now, this bein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the third\\ntime, I kinder got bold, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I went a little closter, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 says:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Sandy, wha-what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the ma-mat-matter with you? Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the boys do the\\nplantin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 right fer you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen as luck would hev it I thought of sumthin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 else right quick, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\nsaid:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Or is it the dust you hev hid whar yer sittin\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWaal, he looked up then, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the happiest smile cum ter his face, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nall ter once he disappeared ag\\xe2\\x80\\x99in. An\\xe2\\x80\\x99 since then I hev sot here an\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nguarded the place till the right one cums along ter claim it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see. What did you say yer name wuz?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPardon me. I thought I had told you. My name is John Willett Barr.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPolly, oh, Polly! Cum hyar, gal. What wuz Sandy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full name? I plum\\nfergot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you want ter know fer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a-goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ter tell you\\nnow. Thet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my own secret.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCum, cum, gal. Tell me ter once, or it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be he\\xe2\\x80\\x99lthy fer you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWaal, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered stubbornly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s John Willett Barr.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt her reply the younger man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face grew deathly pale, and he started up\\nfrom his chair, but Kit thrust him back into his seat, saying:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring me the letter, Polly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ter do with it, pa?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she inquired, cautiously.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI promised old Sandy on my oath ter keep it till the right one cums\\nerlong ter claim it, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I mean ter keep my word. The right one is here,\\ngal. Thar he sits. So trot thet letter out, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t parley long with\\nme if you knows when yer well off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPolly stared at the younger man in utter bewilderment for a moment.\\nThen, turning slowly, she stepped quietly into the cabin after the\\nprecious document; an unusual gleam of joy lighted up her face and a\\nsuppressed excitement shone in her eyes. Under her breath she said:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSumhow er ruther I felt he wuz the right one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nToo truly, John Barr realized in that painful moment that he whom he\\nsought was now dead to him; that the father from whom he had been parted\\nso many years was sleeping that long, dreamless sleep in the clay mound\\non the hillside, which marked his last resting place. As he turned to\\nlook at the face of old, honest Kit, who had been his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend\\nduring those long years of forced exile, a happy smile lit up the old\\nminer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rugged features as he pointed with his finger to the rock cliff\\nnear the old spruce vine, and said, in an exultant, trembling voice:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThar he be, stranger--jes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as I hev seen him many a night--yer dad--my\\npard--pore old Sandy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith an eager voice John Barr sprang forward, and the mountains echoed\\nand re-echoed the plaintive cry of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather! Father!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But his\\noutstretched arms clasped only emptiness and the darkening shadows of\\nthe rapidly approaching night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GHOSTS OF RED CREEK.\\n\\nBY S. T.\\n\\n\\nTo the northward of Mississippi City and its neighbor, Handsboro, there\\nextends a tract of pine forest for miles with but few habitations\\nscattered through it. Black and Red Creeks, with their numerous\\nbranches, drain this region into the Pascagoula River to the eastward.\\nWith the swamps of Pascagoula as a refuge, and the luxuriant and\\nunfrequented bottoms of Red and Black Creeks to browse upon, there are\\nfew choicer spots for deer. Knowing this fact, a small party of\\ngentlemen on the day before a crisp, cold Christmas, started from\\nHandsboro in a large four-wheeled wagon for a thirty-mile drive into\\nthis wilderness of pine and a week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sport after the deer. The guide was\\nJim Caruthers, a true woodsman, and the driver and general factotum, a\\njolly negro named Jack Lyons, than whom no one could make a better\\nhoe-cake and cook a venison steak. His laugh could be heard a quarter of\\na mile, and his good nature was as expansive as the range of the\\nlaughter.\\n\\nThe usual experiences of a hunting camp were heartily enjoyed during\\nthe first days of this life out of doors; but its cream did not rise\\nuntil about the fifth night, when, from familiar intercourse, Jack Lyons\\nbecame loquacious, and after the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s twenty or twenty-five-mile walk,\\nwould spin yarns in front of the camp fire, which brought forgetfulness\\nof fatigue.\\n\\nThe night before New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was intensely cold. The cold north wind of\\nthe afternoon had subsided at sunset, and only a gust now and again\\ntouched the musical leaves of the pines, making them vibrant with that\\nmournful score of nature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operas which even maestros have failed to\\ncatch.\\n\\nIn front of two new and white tents two sportsmen reclined at length\\nwithin reach of the warmth of the fire, while opposite them rested at\\nease the guide and the worthy Jack Lyons.\\n\\nWearied with the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chase four stanch hounds--Ringwood, Rose, Jet and\\nBoxer--were dreaming of future quarry.\\n\\nThe firelight brought out in bright relief the trunks of the tall pines\\nlike cathedral columns, and sparkling through the leafy dome overhead\\nthe scintillating stars glistened with a diamond brightness. A silence\\nwhich added its influence to the scene rested about the borders of the\\ncreek below, and gave more effect to the story of the veteran teamster\\nthan perhaps it otherwise would have had.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf de deer run down de creek,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said old Jack, smacking his lips over a\\ncarefully prepared brewing of the real Campbellton punch, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwese boun\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to\\nsee fun to-morrer, for dey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take us down thar by de old Gibbet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nplace. In daylight dere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no place like it, but after nightfall, you bet\\nyou wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t catch dis nigger thar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOld Jack was naturally asked why he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about visiting the\\nGibbet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place at night. Asking to be excused until he filled his pipe,\\nthe silence was unbroken until his return. He piled on more pine knots\\nand commenced:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou kno\\xe2\\x80\\x99, gemmen, dat when de gunboats was in de sound we folks had to\\ntravel way back hyar on dese roads outun de range of deir big guns. I\\nwas \\xe2\\x80\\x99gaged by Mr. Harrison in hauling salt from de factory at\\nMississippi City, on de beach ober to Mobile, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I had been making a\\ntrip ebery week or so. Dis back country road was neber thought ob by de\\nFederals, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 we had good times long de way, no shells and no shootin\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDe nite, gemmen, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99se speakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of was a Friday, dat yous all knows is\\nunlucky. Well, you see, I hitched up Betsie an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rose in de lead, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ole\\nFox an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Blossom at de pole, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 takes in de biggest load of salt dat\\nteam eber carried. I starts out an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 crosses de Biloxi Riber at Han\\xe2\\x80\\x99sboro\\njes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as de moon was goin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 down. Yes, boss, dese roads weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no better\\nden now, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 de rain had made \\xe2\\x80\\x99em mighty rough when yer come to de\\nholes.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sat in de seat whistlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98De Cows is in de Pea Patch,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and a-thinkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nof Sarah Jamison, what was afterwards my wife, when I felt de off fore\\nwheel go \\xe2\\x80\\x98kersush\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in a hole up to de hub. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d made seventeen miles out\\nob Han\\xe2\\x80\\x99sboro. I did some cussin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 den went to de fence, about twenty\\nyards off, an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 took out a rail to prize up de wheel. Den I saw I was at\\nMister Gibbet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place. I sez to myself, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go up to de house an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 get\\nold Mr. Gibbet to give me a turn. I had done gone by dar two weeks afore\\nan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 seed de old man.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, gemmen, yer listen to me, for what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99se tellin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 yer is as sure as\\nJinny\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll blow de horn on de las\\xe2\\x80\\x99 day. I walked up to de house an\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dar I\\nsaw a bright light inside.

Marie are as white and luminous as\\nthe Milky Way. The silence that rests upon the solitude appears to be\\nwhite also. Nature has included sound in her arrestment. Save the still\\nwhite frost, all things are obliterated. The stars are there, but they\\nseem to belong to heaven and not to earth. They are at an immeasurable\\nheight, and so black is the night that the opaque ether rolls between\\nthem and the observer in great liquid billows.\\n\\nIn such a place it is difficult to believe that the world is peopled to\\nany great extent. One fancies that Cain has just killed Abel, and that\\nthere is need for the greatest economy in the matter of human life.\\n\\nThe night Ralph Hagadorn started out for Echo Bay he felt as if he were\\nthe only man in the world, so complete was the solitude through which he\\nwas passing. He was going over to attend the wedding of his best friend,\\nand was, in fact, to act as the groomsman. Business had delayed him, and\\nhe was compelled to make his journey at night. But he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gone far\\nbefore he began to feel the exhilaration of the skater. His skates were\\nkeen, his legs fit for a longer journey than the one he had undertaken,\\nand the tang of the frost was to him what a spur is to a spirited horse.\\n\\nHe cut through the air as a sharp stone cleaves the water. He could feel\\nthe tumult of the air as he cleft it. As he went on he began to have\\nfancies. It seemed to him that he was enormously tall--a great Viking of\\nthe Northland, hastening over icy fiords to his love. That reminded him\\nthat he had a love--though, indeed, that thought was always present with\\nhim as a background for other thoughts. To be sure, he had not told her\\nshe was his love, because he had only seen her a few times and the\\nopportunity had not presented itself. She lived at Echo Bay, too, and\\nwas to be the maid of honor to his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bride--which was another\\nreason why he skated on almost as swiftly as the wind, and why, now and\\nthen, he let out a shout of exhilaration.\\n\\nThe one drawback in the matter was that Marie Beaujeu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father had\\nmoney, and that Marie lived in a fine house and wore otter skin about\\nher throat and little satin-lined mink boots on her feet when she went\\nsledding, and that the jacket in which she kept a bit of her dead\\nmother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hair had a black pearl in it as big as a pea. These things\\nmade it difficult--nay, impossible--for Ralph Hagadorn to say anything\\nmore than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI love you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But that much he meant to have the satisfaction\\nof saying, no matter what came of it.\\n\\nWith this determination growing upon him he swept along the ice which\\ngleamed under the starlight. Indeed, Venus made a glowing path toward\\nthe west and seemed to reassure him. He was sorry he could not skim down\\nthat avenue of light from the love star, but he was forced to turn his\\nback upon it and face toward the northeast.\\n\\nIt came to him with a shock that he was not alone. His eyelashes were a\\ngood deal frosted and his eyeballs blurred with the cold, and at first\\nhe thought it an illusion. But he rubbed his eyes hard and at length\\nmade sure that not very far in front of him was a long white skater in\\nfluttering garments who sped over the snows fast as ever werewolf went.\\nHe called aloud, but there was no answer, and then he gave chase,\\nsetting his teeth hard and putting a tension on his firm young muscles.\\nBut however fast he might go the white skater went faster. After a time\\nhe became convinced, as he chanced to glance for a second at the North\\nStar, that the white skater was leading him out of his direct path. For\\na moment he hesitated, wondering if he should not keep to his road, but\\nthe strange companion seemed to draw him on irresistibly, and so he\\nfollowed.\\n\\nOf course it came to him more than once that this might be no earthly\\nguide. Up in those latitudes men see strange things when the hoar frost\\nis on the earth. Hagadorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, who lived up there with the Lake\\nSuperior Indians and worked in the copper mines, had once welcomed a\\nwoman at his hut on a bitter night who was gone by morning, and who left\\nwolf tracks in the snow--yes, it was so, and John Fontanelle, the\\nhalf-breed, could tell you about it any day--if he were alive. (Alack,\\nthe snow where the wolf tracks were is melted now!)\\n\\nWell, Hagadorn followed the white skater all the night, and when the ice\\nflushed red at dawn and arrows of lovely light shot up into the cold\\nheavens, she was gone, and Hagadorn was at his destination. Then, as he\\ntook off his skates while the sun climbed arrogantly up to his place\\nabove all other things, Hagadorn chanced to glance lakeward, and he saw\\nthere was a great wind-rift in the ice and that the waves showed blue as\\nsapphires beside the gleaming ice. Had he swept along his intended path,\\nwatching the stars to guide him, his glance turned upward, all his body\\nat magnificent momentum, he must certainly have gone into that cold\\ngrave. The white skater had been his guardian angel!\\n\\nMuch impressed, he went up to his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, expecting to find\\nthere the pleasant wedding furore. But someone met him quietly at the\\ndoor, and his friend came downstairs to greet him with a solemn\\ndemeanor.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this your wedding face?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Hagadorn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, really, if this is\\nthe way you are affected, the sooner I take warning the better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no wedding to-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said his friend.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo wedding? Why, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarie Beaujeu died last night----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarie----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDied last night. She had been skating in the afternoon, and she came\\nhome chilled and wandering in her mind, as if the frost had got in it\\nsomehow. She got worse and worse and talked all the time of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe wondered what it all meant. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know you were lovers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it myself; more\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the pity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe said you were on the ice. She said you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about the big\\nbreaking up, and she cried to us that the wind was off shore. Then she\\ncried that you could come in by the old French Creek if you only\\nknew----?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI came in that way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interrupted Hagadorn.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did you come to do that? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out of your way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo Hagadorn told him how it came to pass.\\n\\nAnd that day they watched beside the maiden, who had tapers at her head\\nand feet, and over in the little church the bride who might have been at\\nher wedding said prayers for her friend. Then they buried her in her\\nbridesmaid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s white, and Hagadorn was there before the altar with her, as\\nhe intended from the first. At midnight the day of the burial her\\nfriends were married in the gloom of the cold church, and they walked\\ntogether through the snow to lay their bridal wreaths on her grave.\\n\\nThree nights later Hagadorn started back again to his home. They wanted\\nhim to go by sunlight, but he had his way and went when Venus made her\\nbright path on the ice. He hoped for the companionship of the white\\nskater. But he did not have it. His only companion was the wind. The\\nonly voice he heard was the baying of a wolf on the north shore. The\\nworld was as white as if it had just been created and the sun had not\\nyet colored nor man defiled it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW HE CAUGHT THE GHOST.\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, the house is a good one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the agent; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in a good\\nneighborhood, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting it at almost nothing; but I think it\\nright to tell you all about it. You are orphans, you say, and with a\\nmother dependent on you? That makes it all the more necessary that you\\nshould know. The fact is, the house is said to be haunted----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe agent could not help smiling as he said it, and he was relieved to\\nsee an answering smile on the two faces before him.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in ghosts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnor do I, for that\\nmatter; but, somehow, the reputation of the house keeps me from having a\\ntenant long at a time. The place ought to rent for twice as much as it\\ndoes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we succeed in driving out the ghost, you will not raise the rent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nasked the boy, with a merry twinkle in his eyes.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, no--not this year, at any rate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d laughed the agent. And so the\\nhouse was rented; and the slip of a girl and the tall lad, her brother,\\nwent their way.\\n\\nWithin a week the family had moved into the house, and were delighted\\nwith it. It was large and cool, with wide halls and fine stairways, and\\nwith more room than they needed. But that did not matter in the least,\\nfor they had always been cramped in small houses, suffering many\\ndiscomforts; and they never could have afforded such a place as this if\\nit had not been \\xe2\\x80\\x9chaunted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlessings on the ghost!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Margaret, gaily, as she ran about as\\nmerry as a child. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho would be without a ghost in the house, when it\\nbrings one like this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it is so near your school,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the mother; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I used to worry\\nso over the long walk; and David can come home to lunch now, and you\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what a pleasure that will be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d David gravely explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat if I should meet the\\nghost I would treat him with the greatest politeness and encourage him\\nto stay. We shall not miss the room he takes, shall we? I think it would\\nbe well to set aside that room over yours, Maggie, for his ghostship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nown, for we shall not need that, you know. Besides, the door doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nshut, and he can go in and out without breaking the lock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then they all laughed and had a great deal of fun over the ghost,\\nwhich was a great joke to them.\\n\\nThey were very tired that night and slept soundly all night long. When\\nthey met the next morning there was more laughter about the ghost which\\nwas shy about meeting strangers, probably, and had made no effort to\\nintroduce himself. For the next three days they were all hard at work,\\ntrying to bring chaos into something like order; and then it was time\\nfor the school to open, and Margaret was to begin teaching, and David\\ninserted an advertisement in the city papers for a maid-of-all-work, who\\nmight help their mother in their absence.\\n\\nFor one whole day prospective colored servants presented themselves and\\nannounced:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs dis de house whar dey wants a worklady? No, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, I ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gwine to\\nwork in dis house. Ketch me workin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in no ha\\xe2\\x80\\x99nted house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter which they each and all departed, and others came in their stead.\\nOne was secured after a while, but no sooner had she talked across the\\nfence with a neighbor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s servant than she, too, departed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mind, children,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Craig, wearily, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would much rather\\ndo the work than be troubled in this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo the maid-of-all-work was dismissed and the Craig family locked the\\ndoors and went to their rooms, worn out with the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anxieties.\\n\\nThey had been in the house four days, and there had been neither sight\\nnor sound of the ghost. The very mention of it was enough to start them\\nall to laughing, for they were thoroughly practical people, with a\\nfondness for inquiring into anything that seemed mysterious to them and\\nfor understanding it thoroughly before they let it go.\\n\\nDavid was soon sleeping the sound sleep of healthy boyhood, and all was\\nsilent in the house, when Margaret stole softly into his room and laid\\nher hand on his arm. He was not easy to waken, and several minutes had\\npassed before he sat up in bed with an articulate murmur of surprise.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHush!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Margaret, in a whisper, with her hand on his lips. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want\\nyou to come into my room and listen to a sound that I have been hearing\\nfor some time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoors creaking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d suggested David, as he began to dress.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing of the kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was all she said.\\n\\nThey walked up the stairway, and along the upper hall to the door of the\\nunused room. Something was wrong with the lock and the door would not\\nstay fastened, as I have said.\\n\\nSomething that was not fear thrilled their hearts as they pushed the\\ndoor further ajar, and stood where they could see every foot of the\\nvacant floor. One of their own boxes stood in the middle of the room,\\nbut aside from that, nothing was to be seen, and they looked at one\\nanother in silence.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHold the lamp a minute, Maggie,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d David said, at last, and then he went\\nall over the room, and looked more particularly at its emptiness, and\\neven felt the walls.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecret panels, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, with a smile, but it was a very\\npuzzled smile indeed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see what it could have been,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Margaret said, as they went down\\nthe stairs.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see, either, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said David. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was a\\nchain, and chains don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t drag around by themselves, you know. A ghost\\ncould not drag a chain, if he were to try.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe conventional ghost very often drags chains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Margaret, as she\\nclosed the door of her room.\\n\\nAnd then she lay awake all night and listened for the conventional ghost\\nthat dragged a chain, but it seemed that the weight of the chain must\\nhave wearied him, for he was not heard again.\\n\\nThe mother had slept through it all, and next morning they gave her a\\nvivid account of the night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adventure.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it was someone in the house,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, in alarm. There were no\\nghosts within the bounds of possibility, so far as she was concerned,\\nbut burglars were very possible, indeed.\\n\\nThen Margaret and David both laughed more than ever.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat fun it would be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said David, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor a burglar to get into this\\nhouse and try to find something worth carrying away!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo they went on to the next night, all three fully determined to spend\\nthe night in listening for the ghost, and running him to earth if\\npossible.\\n\\nBut it was Margaret that heard the ghost, after all. She had been\\nsleeping and was suddenly startled wide awake, and there, overhead, was\\nthe sound of the chain dragging; and just as she was on the point of\\nspringing out of bed to call her brother, the chain seemed to go out of\\nthe upper room. She lay still and listened, and in a moment she heard it\\nagain.\\n\\nIt was coming down the stairs.\\n\\nThere was no carpet on the stairs, and she could hear the chain drop\\nfrom step to step, until it had come the whole way down. There it was,\\nalmost at the door of her room, and something that was strangely like\\nfear kept her lying still, listening in horrified silence.\\n\\nThen it went along the hall, dragging close to the door; and then\\nfurther away; and back and forth for awhile; and then it began dragging\\nback up the stairs again. Step by step she could hear it drawn over the\\nedge of every step--and by the time it had reached the top she\\nremembered herself and called David.\\n\\nAgain did the brother and sister make a tour of the upper room, with the\\nlamp. Not only that, but they looked into every nook and corner of the\\nupper part of the house, and at last came back, baffled. They had seen\\nnothing extraordinary, and they had not heard a sound.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to see that ghost to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d David said to his sister the\\nnext evening.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to sit up all night at the head of the stairs. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say\\nanything about it to mother; it might make her uneasy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo, after the household were all quiet, David slipped into his place at\\nthe head of the stairs, and sat down to his vigil. He had placed a\\nscreen at the head of the stairway so that it hid him from view--as if a\\nghost cared for a screen--and he established himself behind it, and\\nprepared to be as patient as he could.\\n\\nIt seemed to him that hours so long had never been devised as those the\\ntown clocks tolled off that night. He bore it until midnight moderately\\nwell, because, he argued with himself, if there were any ghosts about\\nthey would surely walk then; but they were not in a humor for walking;\\nand still the hours rolled on without any developments. He took the\\nfidgets, and had nervous twitches all over him, and at last he could\\nendure it no longer, and had leaned his head back against the wall and\\nwas going blissfully to sleep when----\\n\\nHe heard a chain dragging just beyond the open door of that unused room.\\n\\nIn spite of himself a shiver ran down his back. There was no mistaking\\nit; it was a real chain, if he had ever heard one. More than that, it\\nhad left the room, and was coming straight towards the stairs. The hall\\nwas dark, and it was impossible for him to see anything, although he\\nstrained his eyes in the direction of the sound. And even while he\\nlooked it had passed behind the screen, and was going down the stairs,\\ndropping from step to step with a clank.\\n\\nHalf way down a narrow strip of moonlight from a stair-window lay\\ndirectly across the steps. Whatever the thing was, it must pass through\\nthat patch of light, and David leaned forward and watched.\\n\\nDown it went from step to step, and presently it had slipped through the\\nlight, and was down; and a little later it came back again, through the\\nlight, and up the stairs, and back into that unused room.\\n\\nAnd then David slapped his knees jubilantly, and ran down to his room,\\nand slept all the rest of the night.\\n\\nNext morning he was very mysterious about his discoveries of the night\\nbefore.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I saw the ghost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to Maggie. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere; don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask so many\\nquestions; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you more about it to-morrow, maybe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd that was all the information she could get from him. It was very\\nprovoking.\\n\\nThat day David made a purchase down town and brought home a bulky\\nbundle, which he hid in his own room and would not let his sister even\\npeep at.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to try to catch a ghost to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand you know how\\nit is; if I brag too much beforehand, I shall be sure to fail.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe was working with something in the hall after the others had retired;\\nbut he did not sit up this time. He went to bed, and Margaret listened\\nat his door and found that he was soon asleep.\\n\\nBut away in the night they were all awakened by a squealing that brought\\nthem all into the hall in a great hurry; and there, at the head of the\\nstairs, they found the huge rat-trap that David had set a few hours\\nbefore, and in the midst of the toils was a rat.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, David,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that there was a rat\\nin the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then, all at once, she saw that there was a long chain hanging from\\na little iron collar around the creature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck, and she and Margaret\\ncried together.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this was the ghost!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuch a funny ghost when they came to think of it--this poor rat, with a\\nnest in some hole of the broken chimney. He had been someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pet,\\nonce, perhaps; and now, the households he had broken up, the nights he\\nhad disturbed, the wild sensations he had created--it made his captors\\nlaugh to think that this innocent creature had been the cause of the\\nwhole trouble.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get a cage for him, and take care of him for the rest of his\\nlife,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said David. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe owe him so much that we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to be\\nungrateful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe next morning he took the ghost-in-a-cage and showed it to the agent,\\nand gave him a vivid account of the capture.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, you have a good house for about half price, all on account of that\\nrat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the agent, grimly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYoung man--but never mind, you\\ndeserve it. What are you working for now? Six dollars a week? If you\\never want to change your place--suppose you come around here. I think\\nyou need a business that will give you a chance to grow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd the agent and David shook hands warmly over the cage of the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cghost.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGRAND-DAME\\xe2\\x80\\x99S GHOST STORY.\\n\\nBY C. D.\\n\\n\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether you ever tell your children ghost stories or not;\\nsome mothers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, but our mother, though of German descent, was\\nstrong-minded on the ghost subject, and early taught all of her children\\nto be fearless mentally as well as physically, and, though dearly fond\\nof hearing ghost stories, especially if they were real true ghosts, we\\nwere sadly skeptical as to their being anything of the kind that could\\nharm. We were quite learned in ghostly lore, knew all about\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoppeigangers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Wisp,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblue lights,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc., and we could\\nnot have a greater treat for good behavior than for our mother to draw\\non her store of supernatural tales for our entertainment. The story I am\\nabout to relate she told us one stormy night, when, gathered round her\\nchair in her own cozy sanctum, before a cheerful fire, we ate nuts and\\napples, and listened while she recited \\xe2\\x80\\x9can o\\xe2\\x80\\x99er true tale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d told her by\\nher grandmother, who herself witnessed the vision:\\n\\nIt was a fearful night, the wind sobbed and wailed round the house like\\nlost spirits mourning their doom; the rain beat upon the casements, and\\nthe trees, writhing in the torture of the fierce blast, groaned and\\nswayed until their tops almost swept the earth; bright flashes of\\nlightning pierced even through the closed shutters and heavy curtains,\\nand the thunder had a sullen, threatening roar that made your blood\\ncreep. It was a night to make one seek to shut out all sound, draw the\\ncurtains close, stir the fire and nestle deep in the arm-chair before\\nit, with feet upon the fender, and have something cheerful to think or\\ntalk about. But I was all alone; none in the house with me but the\\nservants, and the servants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wing was detached from the main part of the\\nbuilding, for I do not care to have menials near me, and I had no loved\\nones near.\\n\\nIt was just such a night that Nancy Black died. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a fearful night\\nfor the soul to leave its earthly home and go out into the vast, unknown\\nfuture!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I spoke aloud, as, rousing from a train of thought, I drew my\\nheavy mantle closer round me, wheeled my arm-chair nearer the fire, and\\ncuddled down in it, burying my feet in the foot-cushion to warm them,\\nfor I felt strangely cold. I was in the library; it was my usual\\nsitting-room, for I seldom used the parlors. What was the use? My books\\nwere my friends, and I loved best to be with them. My children dead, or\\nmarried and away, the cold, grand parlors always seemed gloomy and sad;\\nthe ghosts of departed pleasures haunted them, and I cared not to enter\\nthem.\\n\\nIt was a long, wide room across the hall from the parlors, running the\\nwhole length of the house, and was lined with shelves from floor to\\nceiling. My husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father had been a bibliomaniac, and my husband had\\nhad a leaning that way also, and the shelves held many an old rare work\\nthat was worth its weight in gold. The fire, though burning brightly,\\ndid not illume one-half the room of which, sitting in the chimney\\ncorner, I commanded a full view, and had been looking at the shadows\\nplaying on the furniture and shelves, as the flame shot up, and after\\nflickering a moment, would die out, leaving a gloom which would break\\naway into fantastic shadows as the firelight would again shoot up.\\n\\nWhile watching the gleams of light and darkling shades, unconsciously\\nthe wailing of the storm outside attracted my attention, there seemed to\\nbe odd noises of tapping on the windows, and sobs and sighs, as though\\nsomeone was entreating entrance from the fierce tumult; and as I sat\\nthere, again I thought of Nancy Black, the old schoolgirl friend who had\\nloved me so dearly, and the night when she went forth to meet the doom\\nappointed her; resting my head upon my hand, I sat gazing in the fire,\\nthinking over her strange life, and still stranger death, and wondering\\nwhat could have become of the money and jewels that I knew she had once\\npossessed.\\n\\nWhile sitting thus, a queer sensation crept over me; it was not fear,\\nbut a feeling as though if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d look up I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see something frightful; a\\nshiver, not like that of cold, ran from my head to my feet, and a\\nsensation as though someone was breathing icy cold breath upon my\\nforehead, the same feeling you would cause by holding a piece of ice to\\nyour cheek; it fluttered over my face and finally settled round my lips,\\nas though the unseen one was caressing me, thrilling me with horror. But\\nI am not fearful, nervous nor imaginative, and resolutely throwing off\\nthe dread that fell upon me, I turned round and looked up, and there, so\\nclose by my side that my hand, involuntarily thrown out, passed through\\nher seeming form, stood Nancy Black. It was Nancy Black, and yet not\\nNancy Black; her whole body had a semi-transparent appearance, just as\\nyour hand looks when you hold it between yourself and a strong light;\\nher clothing, apparently the same as worn in life, had a wavy, seething,\\nflickering look, like flames have, and yet did not seem to burn.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the name of God, Nancy Black, what brought you here, and whence came\\nyou?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed.\\n\\nA hollow whisper followed:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, my old friend, for speaking to me, and, oh, how deeply I\\nthank you for thinking of me to-night--I shall have rest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRest! I heard echoed, and a jeering laugh rang through the room that\\nmade her quiver at its sound.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been near you often; but always failed to find you in a\\ncondition when you would be en rapport before to-night. What I came for\\nI will tell you; whence I come, you need not know; suffice it to say,\\nthat were I happy I would not be here on such an errand, nor on such a\\nnight--it is only when the elements are in a tumult, and the winds wail\\nand moan, that we come forth. When you hear these sounds it is souls of\\nthe lost you hear mourning their doom--\\xe2\\x80\\x99tis then they wander up and\\ndown, to and fro, their only release from their fearful home of torture\\nand undying pain.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have come to tell you that you must go over to the old house, and in\\nthe back room I always kept locked, have the carpet taken up from toward\\nthe fireplace. You will see a plank with a knot-hole in it. Remove that,\\nand you will find what caused me to lose my soul--have prayers said for\\nme, for \\xe2\\x80\\x99tis well to pray for the dead. The money and jewels give in\\ncharity; bury in holy ground the others you find, and pray for them and\\nme. Ah! Jeannette, you thought your old friend, though strange and odd,\\npure and innocent. It is a bitter part of my punishment that I must\\nchange your thought of me. Farewell! Do not fail me, and I shall trouble\\nyou no more. But whenever you hear that wind howl and sweep round the\\nhouse as it does to-night, know that the lost are near. It is their\\nswift flight through space--fleeing before the scourge of memory and\\nconscience--that causes that sound.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat to-morrow you may not think you are dreaming, here is a token,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand she touched the palm of my hand with her finger-tips, and as you\\nsee, my child, to this day, there are three crimson spots in the palm of\\nmy hand that nothing will eradicate.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not fail me, and pray for us, Jeannette, pray,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and with a longing,\\nwistful gaze, and a deep, sobbing sigh, Nancy Black faded from my sight.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I dreaming?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, as I rose from my chair and rang the bell.\\nWhen the servant entered, I bade him attend to the fire and light the\\nlamps, and I went through the room to see if any unusual arrangement of\\nthe furniture could have caused the appearance, but nothing was\\napparent, and I bade him send my maid to attend me in my chamber, for I\\ncould not help feeling unwilling to remain in the library any longer\\nthat evening.\\n\\nWhile making my toilet for the night my maid said:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you burned your hand, madam?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGlancing hastily down, I saw three dark crimson spots upon the palm of\\nmy left hand. They had an odd look, seared as though touched by a\\nred-hot iron, yet the flesh was soft, not burned and not painful. Making\\nsome excuse for it, I did not allude to it again, and dismissed her\\nspeedily, that I might reflect undisturbed over the singular occurrence.\\nThere were the marks upon my hand; I could not remove them, and they did\\nnot fade. In fact, their deep red made the rest of the palm lose its\\npinkish hue and look pale from the strong contrast. Could I have been\\nasleep and dreamed it all, and by any means have done this to myself? I\\nthought, but finally concluded that on the morrow I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go over to Nancy\\nBlack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old residence and settle the question; and with that conclusion\\nhad to content myself until the morrow came.\\n\\nNancy Black was an old friend from my girlhood, who had owned large\\nproperty in the town, and lived all alone in a spacious stone house\\ndirectly opposite my home, and who, when dying, had left me the sole\\nlegatee of her property.\\n\\nWhen morning came I took the keys, and, with my maid, went over to\\nNancy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house. It had never been disturbed since her death, which was\\nsudden and somewhat singular, and the furniture remained just as she\\nleft it when taken to her last resting place. We went to the room Nancy\\nhad directed. I bade Sarah take up the carpet, and, sure enough, there\\nwas a plank with a knot-hole in it; so I sent her from the room, and\\nlifted the plank myself, and there, between the two joints, rested a\\nlong box, the lid not fastened. Opening it, I was horrified to see two\\nskeletons--those of an infant and of a woman, small in stature and\\ndelicate frame. In a moment it flashed before me that I saw all that\\nremained of Nancy Black\\xe2\\x80\\x99s young sister, a girl of seventeen, who had\\nleft home somewhat mysteriously years ago, and had died while absent--at\\nleast, that was the version Nancy had given of her absence, and no one\\nhad dreamed of doubting it, her tale was so naturally told.\\n\\nLeft orphans when Lucy was only two years and Nancy eighteen, she had\\ndevoted her life to the care of this young girl, and when she found her\\nsister had fallen, she, in her pride of name and position, had destroyed\\nmother and child, that her shame might not be known, and had lived all\\nthose dreary years in that house with her fearful secret.\\n\\nRound the box, heaped up on every side, were money and jewels, and a\\nparchment scroll among them had written on it: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLucy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of our\\nfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I carried out Nancy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wishes to the letter, for I now\\nfirmly believed that she had come to me herself that night. To avoid\\nscandal resting on the dead, I took our clergyman into my confidence,\\nand with his assistance had the remains buried quietly in consecrated\\nground. The money and jewels were given to the poor, and the old\\nbuilding I turned into a home for destitute females; and morning and\\nnight, as I kneel in prayer, I pray forgiveness to rest upon Nancy Black\\nand peace to her troubled soul.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA FIGHT WITH A GHOST.\\n\\nBY Q. E. D.\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I never believed much in ghosts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the doctor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I was\\nalways rather afraid of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you ever seen one?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked one of the other men.\\n\\nThe doctor took his cigar out of his mouth and contemplated the ash for\\na moment or two before replying. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have had some rather startling\\nexperiences,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, after a pause, during which the rest of us\\nexchanged glances, for the doctor has seen many things and is not averse\\nto talking about them in congenial company. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould you care about\\nhearing one of them? It gives me the cold shivers now to speak of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWe nodded, and the doctor, taking a sip as an antidote to the shivers,\\nbegan:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou remember George Carson, who played for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Varsity some years ago;\\nbig chap, with a light mustache? Well, I saw a good deal of him before\\nhe married, while he was reading for the bar in town. It was just after\\nhe became engaged to Miss Stonor, who is now Mrs. Carson, that he asked\\nme to go down to a place which his people had taken in the country. Miss\\nStonor was to be there and he wanted me to meet her. I could not go down\\nfor Christmas Day, as I had promised to be with my people. But as I had\\nbeen working a bit too hard, and wanted a few days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rest, I decided to\\nrun down for a few days about the New Year.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWoodcote was a pleasant enough place to look at. There were two packs\\nof hounds within easy distance, and it was not far enough from a station\\nto cut you off completely from the morning papers. The Carsons had been\\nlucky, I thought, in coming across such a good house at such a moderate\\nfigure. For, as George told me, the owner had been obliged to go abroad\\nfor his health, and was anxious not to leave the place empty all the\\nwinter. It was an old house, with big gables and preposterous corners\\nall over the place, and you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t walk ten paces along any of the\\npassages without tumbling up or down stairs. But it had been patched\\nfrom time to time and, among other improvements, a big billiard-room had\\nbeen built out at the back. A country house in the winter without a\\nbilliard-room, when the frost stops hunting, is just--well, not even a\\ngilded prison. The party was a small one; besides George and his father\\nand mother, there were only a couple of Misses Carson, who, being\\nsomewhere in the early teens, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count, and Miss Stonor, who, of\\ncourse, counted a good deal, and, lastly, myself.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Stonor ought to have been happy, for George Carson, besides being\\nan excellent fellow all around, was by no means a bad match, being an\\nonly son with considerable expectations. But, somehow or other, she did\\nnot strike me as looking either very well or very happy. She gave me the\\nimpression of having something on her mind, which made her alternately\\nnervous and listless. George, I fancied, noticed it, and was puzzled by\\nit, for I caught him several times watching her with an anxious and\\ninquiring look, but, as I was not there as a doctor, of course it was no\\nbusiness of mine, though I discovered the reason before I left Woodcote.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe second night after my arrival--we had been playing, I remember, a\\nfamily pool; the rest had gone upstairs to bed--George and I adjourned\\nto a sort of study, which he had arranged upstairs, for a final smoke\\nand a chat before turning in. The study was next to his bedroom, and\\nparted off from it by curtains. As we were settling down I missed my\\npipe, and remembered that I had laid it down in the billiard-room. On\\nprinciple I never smoke another man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pipe, so I lit a candle, the house\\nbeing in darkness, and started away in search of my own. The house\\nlooked awfully weird by the flickering light of a solitary candle, and\\nthe stairs creaked in a particularly gruesome way behind me, just for\\nall the world as though someone were following at my heels. I found my\\npipe where I had expected in the billiard-room, and came back in perhaps\\na little more hurry than was absolutely necessary. Which, perhaps,\\nexplains why I stumbled in the uncertain light over a couple of\\nunforeseen stairs, and dropped my candle. Of course it went out, but\\nafter a little groping I found it. Having no matches with me I was\\nobliged to feel my way along the banisters, for it was so dark that I\\ncould not see my hand in front of me. And as I slowly advanced, sliding\\nmy hand along the broad balustrade at my side, it suddenly slid over\\nsomething cold and clammy, which was not balustrade at all; for,\\nstopping dead, and closing my fingers round it for an instant, I felt\\nthat I was holding another hand, a skinny, bony hand, which writhed\\nitself slowly from my grasp. And though I could hear nothing and see\\nnothing, I was yet conscious that something was brushing past me and\\ngoing up the stairs.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi--what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that? Who are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I called.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was no answer.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI admit that I was in a regular funk. I must have shown it in my face.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 asked George, as I blundered into his study.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, nothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I answered; \\xe2\\x80\\x98dropped my candle and lost the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98But who were you talking to?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98I was only swearing at the candle,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I replied.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh! I thought perhaps you had seen--somebody,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 replied George.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomehow I did not like to tell him the truth, for fear he would laugh\\nat my nervousness. But I determined to keep an eye on my liver, and take\\na couple of weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 complete rest. That night I woke up several times\\nwith the feeling of that confounded hand under my own--a clammy hand\\nwhich writhed as my fingers closed upon it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe next morning after breakfast I was in the billiard-room practicing\\nstrokes while Carson was over at the stables. Presently the door opened,\\nand Miss Stonor looked in.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come in,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said; \\xe2\\x80\\x98George will be back from the stables in a few\\nminutes. Meanwhile we can have fifty up.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98I wanted to speak to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was looking very tired and ill, and I began to think I should not\\nhave an uninterrupted holiday after all.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Do you believe in ghosts?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she asked, having closed the door and come\\nup to the table, where she stood leaning with both her hands upon it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98No,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I replied, missing an easy carrom as I remembered my experience\\nof last night, \\xe2\\x80\\x98but I believe in fancy.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98And, supposing then that a person fancied he saw things, is there any\\nremedy?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98What do you mean, Miss Stonor?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I replied, looking at her in some\\nsurprise. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do you mean that you fancy----\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI stopped, for Miss Stonor turned away, sat down on one of the\\neasy-chairs by the wall, and burst into tears.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh! please help me\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she sobbed; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I believe I am going mad.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI laid down my cue and went over to her.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Look here, Miss Stonor,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said, taking her hand, which was hot and\\nfeverish, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I am a doctor, and a friend of George. Now tell me all about\\nit, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do my best to set it right.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was in a more or less hysterical condition, and her words were\\nfreely punctuated by sobs. But gradually I managed to elicit from her\\nthat nearly every night since she came to Woodcote she had been awakened\\nin some mysterious way, and had seen a horrible face looking at her from\\nover the top of a screen which stood by the door of her bedroom. As soon\\nas she moved the face disappeared, which convinced her that the\\napparition existed only in her imagination. That seemed to distress her\\neven more than if she had believed it to be a genuine ghost, for she\\nthought her brain was giving way.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told her that she was only suffering from a very common symptom of\\nnervous disorder, as indeed it was, and promised to send a groom into\\nthe village to get a prescription made up for her. And, having made me\\npromise to breathe no word to anyone on the subject, more especially to\\nGeorge, she went away relieved. Nevertheless, I was not quite certain\\nthat I had made a correct diagnosis of the case. You see I had been\\nrather upset myself not many hours before. George was longer than I\\nexpected at the stable, and I was just going to find him when at the\\ndoor I met Mrs. Carson.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Can you spare me one moment?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said, as I held open the door for\\nher. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I wanted to find you alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Certainly, Mrs. Carson, with pleasure; an hour, if you wish,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I\\nreplied.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98It is so convenient, you know, to have a doctor in the house,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she\\nsaid, with a nervous laugh. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Now I want you to prescribe me a sleeping\\ndraught. My nerves are rather out of order, and--I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep as I\\nshould.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Ah,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98do you see faces--and such like things when you wake?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98How do you know?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she asked quickly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, I inferred from the other symptoms. We doctors have to observe all\\nkinds of little things.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, of course, I know it is only fancy; but it is just as bad as if\\nit were real. I assure you it is making me quite ill; and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like\\nto mention it to Mr. Carson or to George. They would think I was losing\\nmy head.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gave Mrs. Carson the same prescription as I had written for Miss\\nStonor, though by that time the conviction had grown upon me that there\\nwas something wrong which could not be cured by medicine. However, I\\ndecided to say nothing to George about the matter at present. For I\\ncould hardly utilize the confidence which had been placed in me by Miss\\nStonor and Mrs. Carson. And my own experience of the night before would\\nscarcely have appeared convincing to him. But I determined that on the\\nnext day--which was Sunday--I would invent an excuse for staying at home\\nfrom church and make some explorations in the house. There was obviously\\nsome mystery at work which wanted clearing up.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe all sat up rather late that night. There seemed to be a general\\ndisinclination to go to bed. We stayed all together in the billiard-room\\nuntil nearly midnight, and then loitered about in the hall, talking in\\nan aimless sort of fashion. But at last Mrs. Carson said good-night,\\nwith a confidential nod to me, and Miss Stonor murmured, \\xe2\\x80\\x98So many\\nthanks; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and they both went upstairs. George and I parted\\nin the corridor above. Our rooms were opposite each other.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not begin undressing at once, but sat down and tried to piece\\ntogether some theory to account for the uncanniness of things. But the\\nmore I thought, the more perplexing it became. There was no doubt\\nwhatever that I had put my hand on something extremely alive and\\nextremely unpleasant the night before. The bare recollection of it made\\nme shudder. What living thing could possibly be creeping about the house\\nin the dark? It was a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand. Of that I was certain from the size of\\nit. George Carson was out of the question, for he was in his room all\\nthe time. Nor was it likely that Mr. Carson, senior, would steal about\\nhis own house in his socks and refuse to answer when spoken to. The only\\nother man in the house was an eminently respectable-looking butler; and\\nhis hand, as I had noted particularly when he poured out my wine at\\ndinner, was plump and soft, whereas the mysterious hand on the\\nbalustrade was thin and bony. And then, what was the real explanation of\\nthe face which had appeared to the two ladies? Indigestion might have\\nexplained either singly. Extraordinary coincidences do sometimes occur,\\nbut it seemed too extraordinary that a couple of ladies--one old and one\\nyoung--should suffer from the same indigestion in the same house, at the\\nsame time, and with the same symptoms. On the whole, I did not feel at\\nall comfortable, and looked carefully in all the cupboards and recesses,\\nas well as under the bed, before starting to undress. Then I went to the\\ndoor, intending to lock it. Just as my hand was upon the key, I heard a\\nsoft step in the corridor outside, accompanied by a sound which was\\nsomething between a sigh and a groan. Very faint, but quite\\nunmistakable, and, under the circumstances, discomposing. It might, of\\ncourse, be George. Anyhow, I decided to look and see. I turned the\\nhandle gently and opened the door. There was nothing to be seen in the\\ncorridor. But on the opposite side I could see a door open, and George\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nhead peeping round the corner.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hullo!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hullo!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I replied.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Was that you walking up the passage?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98No,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I thought it might be you.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then who the devil was it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll swear I heard someone.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was silence for a few moments. I was wondering whether I had\\nbetter tell him of the fright I had already had, when he spoke again:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98I say, just come here for a bit, old fellow; I want to speak to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI stepped across the passage, and we went together into the little\\nstudy which adjoined his bedroom.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Look here,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said, poking up the fire, which was burning low,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it strike you that there is something very odd about this\\nhouse?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98You mean----\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything about it to the master or Miss Stonor\\nfor fear of frightening them. All the same, scarcely a night passes but\\nI hear curious footsteps on the stairs. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard them yourself,\\nhaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Now you mention it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I confess I have.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98And, what is more,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I was sitting here two nights ago\\nhalf asleep, and--it seems ridiculous, I know, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fact--I\\nsuddenly saw a horrible face glaring at me from between those curtains\\nbehind you. It was gone in a moment, but I saw it as plainly as I see\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI moved my seat uneasily.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Did you look in your bedroom or in the passage?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes--at once,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x98There was nothing to be seen; but twice\\nagain that night I heard footsteps passing--good God!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe started up in his chair, staring straight over my shoulder. I turned\\nquickly and saw the curtains which parted off the bedroom swing\\ntogether.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98What is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I asked, breathlessly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98I saw it again--the same face--between the curtains.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI tore the hangings aside, and rushed into the next room. It was empty.\\nThe lamp was burning upon a side table, and the door was open, just as\\nGeorge had left it. In the passage outside all was quiet. I came back\\ninto the study and found George running his fingers through his hair in\\nperplexity.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98There is clearly one person too many in the house,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I think\\nwe ought to draw the place and find out who it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98All right,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said he, picking up the poker from the fireplace; \\xe2\\x80\\x98if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nanything made of flesh and blood this will be useful, and if not----\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe stopped short, for at that instant the most awful shriek of horror\\nrang through the house--a shriek of wild, uncontrollable terror, such as\\nI had never heard before and I never hope to hear again. One moment we\\nstood staring at each other, dumbfounded. The next George Carson had\\ndashed out of the room and down the corridor to the stairs. I followed\\nclose behind him. For we both knew that none but a woman in mortal fear\\nwould shriek like that, and that that woman was Miss Stonor.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown the stairs we tumbled pell-mell in the darkness. But before I\\nreached the landing below, where Miss Stonor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room was, I felt, as I\\nhad felt the evening before, something brush swiftly past me. As I ran I\\nturned and caught at it in the dark. But my hand gripped only empty air.\\nI was just about to turn back and follow it, when a cry from George\\narrested me, and, looking down, I saw him standing over the prostrate\\nform of Miss Stonor. The door of her room was open, and by the moonlight\\nwhich streamed into the room I could see her lying in her white\\nnightdress across the threshold. What followed in the next few minutes\\nI can scarcely recall with accuracy. The whole house was aroused by the\\npoor girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awful shriek. She was quite unconscious when we came upon\\nher, but she revived more or less as soon as Mrs. Carson and one of the\\nterrified servants had lifted her into bed again. Nothing intelligible\\ncould be gathered from her, however, as to the cause of her fright; she\\nonly repeated, hysterically, again and again:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, the face; the face!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I saw I could do her no further good for the present, I took\\nGeorge by the arm and led him out of the room.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Look here, George,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98we must find out the reason of this at\\nonce. I am certain I felt something go by me as I came downstairs. Now\\ndoes that staircase lead anywhere but to our rooms?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeorge considered for a moment.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x98there is a door at the end of the passage which\\nleads up into a sort of lumber room.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explore it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said. \\xe2\\x80\\x98For my part I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to sleep until\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to the bottom of this. Get the man to bring a lantern along.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe butler looked as though he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t half like the enterprise, and, to\\ntell the truth, no more did I. It was the uncanniest job I ever\\nundertook. However, we started, the three of us. First of all we\\nsearched the rooms on the floor above, where George and I slept.\\nEverything was just as we had left it. Then I pushed open the door at\\nthe end of the corridor. A crazy-looking staircase led up into darkness.\\nWe went cautiously up, I first with a candle, then George, and last of\\nall the butler with a lantern. At the top we stepped into a big, rather\\nlow room, with beams across the ceiling, and a rough, uneven floor. Our\\nlights threw strange shadows into the corners, and more than once I\\nstarted at what looked like a crouching human figure. We searched every\\ncorner. There was nothing to be seen but a few old boxes, a roll or two\\nof matting, and some broken chairs. But in the far corner George pointed\\nout to me a rickety ladder which ended at a closed trap-door. Just then\\nI distinctly heard the curious, half groaning, half sighing sound which\\nhad already puzzled me in the corridor below. We stood still and looked\\nat one another. We all heard the sound.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Whatever it is, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up there,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said. \\xe2\\x80\\x98The question is, who is going\\nup?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeorge put his candle down upon the floor and stepped upon the ladder.\\nIt cracked beneath his weight. He stopped.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come down; it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bear you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I said. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I shall have to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that I was ever in such a queer funk as I was while I\\nslowly mounted that ladder, and pushed open the trap-door. I had formed\\nno clear idea of what I expected to find there. Certainly I was not\\nprepared for what happened. For no sooner was the trap-door fully open\\nthan there fell--literally fell--upon me from the darkness above a thing\\nin human shape, which kicked and spat and tore at me as I stood clinging\\nto the ladder. It lasted but a moment or so, but in that moment I lived\\na lifetime of terror. The ladder swayed and cracked beneath me, and I\\nfell to the floor with the thing gripping my throat like a vise. The\\nnext instant George had stunned it with a blow from the poker and\\ndragged it off me. It lay upon its back on the floor--a ragged, hideous,\\nloathsome shape. And the mystery was solved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t told us what it really was,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the listeners.\\n\\nThe doctor smiled.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was the owner of the house,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe had not gone abroad. He\\nhad gone to a private lunatic asylum with homicidal mania upon him.\\nAbout a fortnight before this he had managed to escape; and, having made\\nhis way to his former home, had concealed himself, with a cunning often\\nshown by lunatics, in the loft. I suppose he had found enough to eat in\\nhis nightly rambles about the house. The only wonder is that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nkill someone before he was caught.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL HALIFAX\\xe2\\x80\\x99S GHOST STORY.\\n\\n\\nI had just come back to England, after having been some years in India,\\nand was looking forward to meet my friends, among whom there was none I\\nwas more anxious to see than Sir Francis Lynton. We had been to Eton\\ntogether, and for the short time I had been at Oxford, before entering\\nthe army, we had been at the same college. Then we had parted. He came\\ninto the title and estates of the family in Yorkshire on the death of\\nhis grandfather--his father had predeceased--and I had been over a good\\npart of the world. One visit, indeed, I had made him in his Yorkshire\\nhome, before leaving for India, of but a few days.\\n\\nIt will be easily imagined how pleasant it was, two or three days after\\nmy arrival in London, to receive a letter from Lynton, saying that he\\nhad just seen in the papers that I had arrived, and, begging me to come\\ndown at once to Byfield, his place in Yorkshire.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not to tell me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you cannot come. In fact, you\\nare to come on Monday. I have a couple of horses which will just suit\\nyou; the carriage shall meet you at Packham, and all you have got to do\\nis to put yourself in the train which leaves Kings Cross at twelve\\no\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAccordingly, on the day appointed, I started, in due time reached\\nPackham, losing much time on a detestable branch line, and there found\\nthe dog-cart of Sir Francis awaiting me. I drove at once to Byfield.\\n\\nThe house I remembered. It was a low gable structure of no great size,\\nwith old-fashioned lattice windows, separated from the park, where were\\ndeer, by a charming terraced garden.\\n\\nNo sooner did the wheels crunch the gravel by the principal entrance,\\nthan, almost before the bell was rung, the porch-door opened, and there\\nstood Lynton himself, whom I had not seen for so many years, hardly\\naltered, and with all the joy of welcome beaming in his face. Taking me\\nby both hands, he drew me into the house, got rid of my hat and wraps,\\nlooked me all over, and then, in a breath, began to say how glad he was\\nto see me, what a real delight it was to have got me at last under his\\nroof, and what a good time we would have together, like the old days\\nover again.\\n\\nHe had sent my luggage up to my room, which was ready for me, and he\\nbade me make haste and dress for dinner.\\n\\nSo saying he took me through a paneled hall, up an old oak staircase,\\nand showed me my room, which, hurried as I was, I observed was hung\\nwith tapestry, and had a large four-post bed, with velvet curtains,\\nopposite the window.\\n\\nThey had gone in to dinner when I came down, despite all the haste I\\nmade in dressing; but a place had been kept for me next Lady Lynton.\\n\\nBesides my hosts, there were their two daughters, Colonel Lynton, a\\nbrother of Sir Francis, the chaplain, and some others, whom I do not\\nremember distinctly.\\n\\nAfter dinner there was some music in the hall, and a game of whist in\\nthe drawing-room, and after the ladies had gone upstairs, Lynton and I\\nretired to the smoking-room, where we sat up talking the better part of\\nthe night. I think it must have been near three when I retired. Once in\\nbed I slept so soundly that my servant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entrance the next morning\\nfailed to arouse me, and it was past nine when I awoke.\\n\\nAfter breakfast and the disposal of the newspapers, Lynton retired to\\nhis letters, and I asked Lady Lynton if one of her daughters might show\\nme the house. Elizabeth, the eldest, was summoned, and seemed in no way\\nto dislike the task.\\n\\nThe house was, as already intimated, by no means large; it occupied\\nthree sides of a square, the entrance and one end of the stables making\\nthe fourth side. The interior was full of interest--passages, rooms,\\ngalleries, as well as hall, were paneled in dark wood and hung with\\npictures. I was shown everything on the ground\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Losing much time on a detestable branch line._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\nfloor, and then on the first floor. Then my guide proposed that we\\nshould ascend a narrow, twisting staircase that led to a gallery. We did\\nas proposed, and entered a handsome long room or passage leading to a\\nsmall chamber at one end, in which my guide told me her father kept\\nbooks and papers.\\n\\nI asked if anyone slept in this gallery, as I noticed a bed and\\nfireplace, and rods by means of which curtains might be drawn, enclosing\\none portion where were bed and fireplace, so as to convert it into a\\nvery cosy chamber.\\n\\nShe answered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the place was not really used, except as a playroom;\\nthough, sometimes, if the house happened to be very full--in her\\ngreat-grandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time--she had heard that it had been occupied.\\n\\nBy the time we had been over the house, and I had also been shown the\\ngarden and the stables, and introduced to the dogs, it was nearly one\\no\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock. We were to have an early luncheon, and to drive afterwards to\\nsee the ruins of one of the grand old Yorkshire abbeys.\\n\\nThis was a pleasant expedition, and we got back just in time for tea,\\nafter which there was some reading aloud. The evening passed much in the\\nsame way as the preceding one, except that Lynton, who had some\\nbusiness, did not go down into the smoking-room, and I took the\\nopportunity of retiring early in order to write a letter for the Indian\\nmail, something having been said as to the prospect of hunting the next\\nday.\\n\\nI had finished my letter, which was a long one, together with two or\\nthree others, and had just got into bed, when I heard a step overhead,\\nas of someone walking along the gallery, which I now knew ran\\nimmediately above my room. It was a slow, heavy, measured tread which I\\ncould hear getting gradually louder and nearer, and then as gradually\\nfading away, as it retreated into the distance.\\n\\nI was startled for a moment, having been told that the gallery was\\nunused; but the next instant it occurred to me that I had been told it\\ncommunicated with a chamber where Sir Francis kept books and papers. I\\nknew he had some writing to do, and I thought no more on the matter.\\n\\nI was down the next morning at breakfast in good time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow late you\\nwere last night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I said to Lynton, in the middle of breakfast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI heard\\nyou overhead after one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLynton replied rather shortly: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed you did not, for I was in bed\\nlast night before twelve.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was someone certainly moving overhead last night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I answered,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I heard his steps as distinctly as I ever heard anything in my life\\ngoing down the gallery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which Colonel Lynton remarked that he had often fancied he had\\nheard steps on the staircase, when he knew that no one was about. He was\\napparently disposed to say more, when his brother interrupted him\\nsomewhat curtly, as I fancied, and asked me if I should feel inclined\\nafter breakfast to have a horse and go out and look for the hounds. They\\nmet a considerable way off, but if they did not find in the coverts they\\nwould first draw, a thing not improbable, they would come our way, and\\nwe might fall in with them about one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock and have a run. I said\\nthere was nothing I should like better. Lynton mounted me on a very nice\\nchestnut, and the rest of the party having gone out shooting, and the\\nyoung ladies being otherwise engaged, he and I started about eleven\\no\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock for our ride.\\n\\nIt was a beautiful day, soft, with a bright sun, one of those beautiful\\ndays which so frequently occur in the early part of November.\\n\\nOn reaching the hilltop where Lynton had expected to meet the hounds, no\\ntrace of them was to be discovered. They must have found at once, and\\nrun in a different direction. At three o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, after we had eaten our\\nsandwiches, Lynton reluctantly abandoned all hopes of falling in with\\nthe hounds, and said we would return home by a slightly different route.\\n\\nWe had not descended the hill before we came on an old chalk quarry and\\nthe remains of a disused kiln.\\n\\nI recollected the spot at once. I had been here with Sir Francis on my\\nformer visit, many years ago. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, bless me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo you remember,\\nLynton, what happened here when I was with you before? There had been\\nmen engaged removing chalk, and they came on a skeleton under some depth\\nof rubble. We went together to see it removed, and you said you would\\nhave it preserved till it could be examined by some ethnologist or\\nanthropologist, any one of those dry-as-dusts, to decide whether the\\nremains were dolichocephalous or brachycephalous--whether British,\\nDanish, or--modern. What was the result?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSir Francis hesitated a moment, and then answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is true, I had\\nthe remains removed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas there an inquest?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. I had been opening some of the tumuli on the Wolds. I had sent a\\ncrouched skeleton and some skulls to the Scarsborough museum. This, I\\nwas doubtful about--whether it was a prehistoric interment--in fact, to\\nwhat date it belonged. No one thought of an inquest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOn reaching the house, one of the grooms who took the horses, in answer\\nto a question from Lynton, said that Colonel and Mrs. Hampshire had\\narrived about an hour ago, and that, one of the horses being lame, the\\ncarriage in which they had driven over from Castle Frampton was to put\\nup for the night. In the drawing-room we found Lady Lynton pouring out\\ntea for her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sister and her husband, who, as we came in,\\nexclaimed: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have come to beg a night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lodging.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt appeared that they had been on a visit in the neighborhood, and had\\nbeen obliged to leave at a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notice in consequence of a sudden\\ndeath in the house where they were staying, and that, in the\\nimpossibility of getting a fly, their hosts had sent them over to\\nByfield.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe thought,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hampshire went on to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat as we were coming\\nhere the end of next week, you would not mind having us a little sooner;\\nor that, if the house were quite full, you would be willing to put us up\\nanywhere till Monday, and let us come back later.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLady Lynton interposed with the remark that it was all settled; and\\nthen, turning to her husband, added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I want to speak to you for a\\nmoment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey both left the room together.\\n\\nLynton came back almost immediately, and, making an excuse to show me,\\non a map in the hall, the point to which we had ridden, said, as soon as\\nwe were alone, with a look of considerable annoyance: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid we\\nmust ask you to change your room. Shall you mind very much? I think we\\ncan make you quite comfortable upstairs in the gallery, which is the\\nonly room available. Lady Lynton has had a good fire lit; the place is\\nreally not cold, and it will be only for a night or two. Your servant\\nhas been told to put your things together, but Lady Lynton did not like\\nto give orders to have them actually moved before my speaking to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI assured him that I did not mind in the very least; that I should be\\nquite as comfortable upstairs; but that I did mind very much their\\nmaking such a fuss about a matter of that sort with an old friend like\\nmyself.\\n\\nCertainly nothing could look more comfortable than my new lodging when I\\nwent upstairs to dress. There was a bright fire in the large grate, an\\narm-chair had been drawn up beside it, and all my books and writing\\nthings had been put in, with a reading-lamp in the central position, and\\nthe heavy tapestry curtains were drawn, converting this part of the\\ngallery into a room to itself. Indeed, I felt somewhat inclined to\\ncongratulate myself on the change. The spiral staircase had been one\\nreason against this place having been given to the Hampshires. No lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlong dress trunk could have mounted it.\\n\\nSir Francis was necessarily a good deal occupied in the evening with his\\nsister and her husband, whom he had not seen for some time. Colonel\\nHampshire had also just heard that he was likely to be ordered to Egypt,\\nand when Lynton and he retired to the smoking-room, instead of going\\nthere I went upstairs to my own room to finish a book in which I was\\ninterested. I did not, however, sit up long, and very soon went to bed.\\n\\nBefore doing so, I drew back the curtains on the rods, partly because I\\nlike plenty of air where I sleep, and partly also because I thought I\\nmight like to see the play of the moonlight on the floor in the portion\\nof the gallery beyond where I lay, and where the blinds had not been\\ndrawn.\\n\\nI must have been asleep for some time, for the fire, which I had left in\\nfull blaze, was gone to a few sparks wandering among the ashes, when I\\nsuddenly awoke with the impression of having heard a latch click at the\\nfurther extremity of the gallery, where was the chamber containing books\\nand papers.\\n\\nI had always been a light sleeper, but on the present occasion I woke at\\nonce to complete and acute consciousness, and with a sense of stretched\\nattention which seemed to intensify all my faculties. The wind had\\nrisen, and was blowing in fitful gusts round the house.\\n\\nA minute or two passed, and I began almost to fancy I must have been\\nmistaken, when I distinctly heard the creak of the door, and then the\\nclick of the latch falling back into place. Then I heard a sound on the\\nboards as of one moving in the gallery. I sat up to listen, and as I did\\nso I distinctly heard steps coming down the gallery.\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Who are you?_\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\nI heard them approach and pass my bed; I could see nothing, all was\\ndark; but I heard the tread proceeding toward where were the uncurtained\\nand unshuttered windows, two in number; but the moon shone through only\\none of these, the nearest--the other was dark, shadowed by the chapel or\\nsome other building at right angles. The tread seemed to me to pause now\\nand again, and then continue as before.\\n\\nI now fixed my eyes intently on the one illumined window, and it\\nappeared to me as if some dark body passed across it; but what? I\\nlistened intently, and heard the step proceed to the end of the gallery,\\nand then return.\\n\\nI again watched the lighted window, and immediately that the sound\\nreached that portion of the long passage it ceased momentarily, and I\\nsaw, as distinctly as I ever saw anything in my life, by moonlight, a\\nfigure of a man with marked features, in what appeared to be a fur cap\\ndrawn over the brows.\\n\\nIt stood in the embrasure of the window, and the outline of the face was\\nin silhouette; then it moved on, and as it moved I again heard the\\ntread.\\n\\nI was as certain as I could be that the thing, whatever it was, or the\\nperson, whoever he was, was approaching my bed.\\n\\nI threw myself back in the bed, and as I did see a mass of charred wood\\non the hearth fell down and sent up a flash of--I fancy sparks, that\\ngave out a glare into the darkness, and by that--red as blood--I saw a\\nface near me.\\n\\nWith a cry, over which I had as little control as the scream uttered by\\na sleeper in the agony of a nightmare, I called, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was an instant during which my hair bristled on my head, as in the\\nhorror of the darkness I prepared to grapple with the being at my side;\\nwhen a board creaked as if someone had moved, and I heard the footsteps\\nretreat, and again the click of the latch.\\n\\nThe next instant there was a rush on the stairs and Lynton burst into\\nthe room, just as he had sprung out of bed, crying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake,\\nwhat is the matter? Are you ill?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could not answer. Lynton struck a light and leaned over the bed. Then\\nI seized him by the arm, and said, without moving: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere has been\\nsomething in this room--gone in thither.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of my mouth when Lynton, following the\\ndirection of my eyes, had sprung to the end of the corridor and thrown\\nopen the door there.\\n\\nHe went into the room beyond, looked round it, returned, and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\nmust have been dreaming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBy this time I was out of bed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook for yourself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, and he led me into the little room. It was\\nbare, with cupboards and boxes, a sort of lumber place. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is\\nnothing beyond this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno door, no staircase. It is a blind\\nway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow pull on your dressing-gown and come downstairs\\nto my sanctum.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI followed him, and after he had spoken to Lady Lynton, who was standing\\nwith the door of her room ajar in a state of great agitation, he turned\\nto me, and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo one can have been in your room. You see, my and my\\nwife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apartments are close below, and no one could come up the spiral\\nstaircase without passing my door. You must have had a nightmare.\\nDirectly you screamed I rushed up the steps, and met no one descending;\\nand there is no place of concealment in the lumber-room at the end of\\nthe gallery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThen he took me into his private snuggery, blew up the fire, lighted a\\nlamp, and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be really grateful if you will say nothing\\nabout this. There are some in the house and neighborhood who are silly\\nenough as it is. You stay here, and if you do not feel inclined to go to\\nbed, read--here are books. I must go to Lady Lynton, who is a good deal\\nfrightened, and does not like to be left alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe then went to his bedroom.\\n\\nSleep, as far as I was concerned, was out of the question, nor do I\\nthink Sir Francis and his wife slept much, either.\\n\\nI made up the fire, and after a time took up a book, and tried to read,\\nbut it was useless.\\n\\nI sat absorbed in thoughts and questionings till I heard the servants\\nstirring in the morning. I went to my own room, left the candle burning,\\nand got into bed. I had just fallen asleep when my servant brought me a\\ncup of tea at eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock.\\n\\nAt breakfast Colonel Hampshire and his wife asked if anything had\\nhappened in the night, as they had been much disturbed by noises\\noverhead, to which Lynton replied that I had not been very well, and had\\nan attack of cramp, and that he had been upstairs to look after me. From\\nhis manner I could see that he wished me to be silent, and I said\\nnothing accordingly.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, when everyone had gone out, Sir Francis took me into\\nhis snuggery, and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalifax, I am very sorry about that matter last\\nnight. It is quite true, what my brother said, that steps have been\\nheard about this house, but I never gave heed to such things, putting\\nall noises down to rats. But after your experiences I feel that it is\\ndue to you to tell you something, and also to make to you an\\nexplanation. There is--there was--no one in the room at the end of the\\ncorridor, except the skeleton that was discovered in the chalk-pit when\\nyou were here many years ago. I confess I had not paid much heed to it.\\nMy arch\\xc3\\xa6ological fancies passed; I had no visits from anthropologists;\\nthe bones and skull were never shown to experts, but remain packed in a\\nchest in that lumber-room. I confess I ought to have buried them, having\\nno more scientific use for them, but I did not--on my word, I forgot all\\nabout them, or, at least, gave no heed to them. However, what you have\\ngone through, and have described to me, has made me uneasy, and has also\\ngiven me a suspicion that I can account for that body in a manner that\\nhad never occurred to me before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter a pause, he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I am going to tell you is known to no one\\nelse, and must not be mentioned by you--anyhow, in my lifetime. You know\\nnow that, owing to the death of my father when quite young, I and my\\nbrother and sister were brought up here with our grandfather, Sir\\nRichard. He was an old, imperious, hot-tempered man. I will tell you\\nwhat I have made out of a matter that was a mystery for long, and I will\\ntell you afterwards how I came to unravel it. My grandfather was in the\\nhabit of going out at night with a young under-keeper, of whom he was\\nvery fond, to look after the game and see if any poachers, whom he\\nregarded as his natural enemies, were about.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne night, as I suppose, my grandfather had been out with the young man\\nin question, and, returning by the plantations, where the hill is\\nsteepest, and not far from the chalk-pit you\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_He and the keeper buried the body._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\nremarked on yesterday, they came upon a man who, though not actually\\nbelonging to the country, was well known in it as a sort of traveling\\ntinker of indifferent character and a notorious poacher. Mind this, I am\\nnot sure it was at the place I mention; I only now surmise it. On the\\nparticular night in question, my grandfather and the keeper must have\\ncaught this man setting snares; there must have been a tussle, in the\\ncourse of which, as subsequent circumstances have led me to imagine, the\\nman showed fight, and was knocked down by one or the other of the\\ntwo--my grandfather or the keeper. I believe that after having made\\nvarious attempts to restore him, they found that the man was actually\\ndead.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were both in great alarm and concern--my grandfather especially.\\nHe had been prominent in putting down some factory riots, and had given\\norders to the military to fire, whereby several lives had been lost.\\nThere was a vast outcry against him, and a certain political party had\\ndenounced him as an assassin. No man was more vituperated; yet now, in\\nmy conscience, I believe he acted with both discretion and pluck, and\\narrested a mischievous movement that might have led to much bloodshed.\\nBe that as it may, my impression is that he lost his head over this\\nfatal affair with the tinker, and that he and the keeper together buried\\nthe body secretly, not far from the place where he was killed. I now\\nthink it was in the chalk-pit, and that the skeleton found years after\\nthere belonged to this man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, as at once my mind rushed back to the\\nfigure with the fur cap that I had seen against the window.\\n\\nSir Francis went on: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe sudden disappearance of the tramp, in view of\\nhis well-known habits and wandering mode of life, did not for some time\\nexcite surprise; but, later on, one or two circumstances having led to\\nsuspicion, an inquiry was set on foot, and among others, my\\ngrandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keepers were examined before the magistrates. It was\\nremembered afterwards that the under-keeper in question was absent at\\nthe time of the inquiry, my grandfather having sent him with some dogs\\nto a brother-in-law of his who lived upon the moors; but whether anyone\\nnoticed the fact, or if they did, preferred to be silent, no\\nobservations were made. Nothing came of the investigation, and the whole\\nsubject would have been dropped if it had not been that two years later,\\nfor some reasons I do not understand, but at the instigation of a\\nmagistrate recently imported into the division, whom my grandfather\\ngreatly disliked, and who was opposed to him in politics, a fresh\\ninquiry was instituted. In the course of that inquiry it transpired\\nthat, owing to some unguarded words dropped by the under-keeper, a\\nwarrant was about to be issued for his arrest. My grandfather, who had a\\nfit of the gout, was away from home at the time, but on hearing the news\\nhe came home at once. The evening he returned he had a long interview\\nwith the young man, who left the house after he had supped in the\\nservants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hall. It was observed that he looked much depressed. The\\nwarrant was issued the next day, but in the meantime the keeper had\\ndisappeared. My grandfather gave orders to his people to do everything\\nin their power to assist the authorities in the search that was at once\\nset on foot, but was unable himself to take any share in it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo trace of the keeper was found, although at a subsequent period\\nrumors circulated that he had been heard of in America. But the man\\nhaving been unmarried, he gradually dropped out of remembrance, and as\\nmy grandfather never allowed the subject to be mentioned in his\\npresence, I should probably never have known anything about it but for\\nthe vague tradition which always attaches to such events, and for this\\nfact, that after my grandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death, a letter came addressed to him\\nfrom somewhere in the United States from some one--the name different\\nfrom that of the keeper--but alluding to the past, and implying the\\npresence of a common secret, and, of course, with it came a request for\\nmoney. I replied, mentioning the death of Sir Richard, and asking for\\nan explanation. I did get an answer, and it is from that that I am able\\nto fill in so much of the story. But I never learned where the man had\\nbeen killed and buried, and my next letter to the fellow was returned\\nwith \\xe2\\x80\\x98deceased\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written across it. Somehow, it never occurred to me till\\nI heard your story that possibly the skeleton in the chalk-pit might be\\nthat of the poaching tinker. I will now most assuredly have it buried in\\nthe churchyard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat certainly ought to be done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said I.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Francis, after a pause, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI give you my word--after the\\nburial of the bones, and you are gone, I will sleep for a week in the\\nbed in the gallery, and report to you if I see or hear anything. If all\\nbe quiet, then--well, you form your own conclusions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI left a day after. Before long I got a letter from my friend, brief,\\nbut to the point: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll quiet, old boy; come again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GHOST OF THE COUNT.\\n\\n\\nNot far from the Alameda, in the City of Mexico, there is a great old\\nstone building, in which once lived a very wealthy and wicked Spanish\\ncount. The house has about four floors, and ninety rooms, more or less.\\nThe entire fourth floor is rented and occupied by a big American firm,\\nand their bookkeeper, an American girl, has given us the following true\\naccount of the ghost that for years haunted the building. The second\\nfloor is unoccupied, as no one cares to live there for obvious reasons.\\nAnd the bottom floor is also unoccupied, save for lumber rooms, empty\\nboxes and crates and barrels. And last of all is the great patio with\\nits tiled floor, where secretly in the night a duel was fought to the\\ndeath by the wicked count and a famous Austrian prince, who was one of\\nMaximilian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s men. The count was killed.\\n\\nNo one knows why the duel was fought; some say it was because of a\\nbeautiful Spanish woman; some say that it was because of treasure that\\nthe two jointly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconveyed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and which the count refused to divide with\\nhis princely \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocio,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and more people--Mexicans--shrug their shoulders\\nif you ask about it, and say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuien sabe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw a ghost here last night, Miss James,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d announces our cashier with\\nmuch eclat and evident pride.\\n\\nSo great is the shock that I gasp, and my pen drops, spattering red ink\\non my nice fresh cuffs, and (worse luck!) on the ledger page that I had\\njust totted up. It is ruined, and I will have to erase it,\\nor--something! Wretched man!\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish to goodness it had taken you off,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I cry, wrathfully, as I look\\nat the bespattered work. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow will you just look here and see what you\\nhave done? I wish you and your ghosts were in----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGehenna?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquires, sweetly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fix that--it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take half a\\nminute. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look so stern, else I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell you about the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98espanto.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And you will be sorry if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear about it--it would\\nmake such a good story.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Insinuatingly.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen go ahead with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Ungraciously.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, last night I was waiting for West. He was to meet me here, after\\nwhich it was our intention to hit the--that is, I mean we were going out\\ntogether. (I nod scornfully.) And it seems that while I was patiently\\nwaiting here, in my usual sweet-tempered way, the blank idiot had his\\nsupper and then lay down to rest himself for a while. You know how\\ndelicate he is? (Another contemptuous nod.) Unfortunately he forgot the\\nengagement, and slept on. He says he never awoke until three o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock,\\nand so didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come, thinking I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be there. Meantime I also went\\nto sleep, and might have snoozed on until three, likewise, but for the\\nfact that the ghost woke me----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell? Do go on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I urge.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ghost woke me, as I said,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d proceeds the simpleton, slowly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was\\npassing its cold fingers over my face and groaning. Really, it was most\\nextraordinary. At first I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what it was; then, as I felt the\\nicy fingers stroking my face and heard blood-curdling groans issuing\\nfrom the darkness, I knew what it was. And I remembered the story of the\\nprince and his little duel down in the patio, and knew it was the ghost\\nof the prince\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victim. By the way, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what a funny\\nsensation it is to have a ghost pat your face, Miss James----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPat nothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I retort, indignantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder you are not ashamed to\\ntell me such fibs. Such a ta-ra-diddle! And as for the man that the\\nprince killed downstairs, you know as well as I do that he was taken\\nhome to Spain and buried there. Why, then, should he come back here,\\ninto our offices, and pat your face?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, that I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a supercilious drawl. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can only account\\nfor it by thinking that the ghost has good taste--better than that of\\nsome people I know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaningly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut honestly, I swear that I am telling\\nyou the truth--cross my heart and hope to die if I am not! And you\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how brave I was--I never screamed; in fact, I never made a\\nsound; oh, I was brave!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen what did you do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sternly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ran. Por Dios, how I ran! You remember with what alacrity we got down\\nthe stairs during the November earthquake? (I remember only too\\ndistinctly.) Well, last night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s run wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a run, in comparison--it was\\na disappearance, a flight, a sprint! I went down the four flights of\\nstairs like a streak of blue lightning, and the ghost flew with me. I\\nheard the pattering of its steps and its groans clean down to the patio\\ndoor, and I assure you I quite thought I had made such an impression\\nthat it was actually going on home with me. And the thought made me feel\\nso weak that I felt perforce obliged to take a--have a--that is,\\nstrengthen myself with a cocktail. After which I felt stronger and went\\nhome quite peacefully. But it was an uncanny experience, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas it before or after taking that cocktail?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I ask, incredulously.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd did you take one only or eleven?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI am hard on the man, but he really deserves it. Ghosts! Spirits,\\nperhaps, but not ghosts. Whereat his feelings are quite \\xe2\\x80\\x9churted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--so\\nmuch so that he vows he will never tell me anything again; I had better\\nread about Doubting Thomas; he never has seen such an unbelieving woman\\nin all his life, and if I were only a man he would be tempted to pray\\nthat I might see the ghost; it would serve me right. Then, wrathfully\\ndeparts, to notice me no more that day.\\n\\nNot believing the least bit in ghosts I gave the matter no more thought.\\nIn fact, when you fall heir to a set of books that haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been posted\\nfor nineteen days, and you have to do it all, and get up your trial\\nbalance, too, or else give up your Christmas holidays, you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much\\ntime to think about ghosts, or anything else, except entries. And though\\nI had been working fourteen hours per day, the 24th of December, noon\\nhour, found me with a difference of $13.89. The which I, of course, must\\nlocate and straighten out before departing next morning on my week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nholiday. Por supuesto, it meant night work. Nothing else would do; and\\nbesides, our plans had all been made to leave on the eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock train\\nnext morning. So I would just sit up all night, if need be, and find the\\nwretched balance and be done with it.\\n\\nBehold me settled for work that night at seven o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in my own office,\\nwith three lamps burning to keep it from looking dismal and lonely, and\\nbooks and ledgers and journals piled up two feet high around me. If hard\\nwork would locate that nasty, hateful $13.89 it would surely be found. I\\nhad told the portero downstairs on the ground floor to try and keep\\nawake for a time, but if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t soon finish the work I would come down\\nand call him when I was ready to go home.\\n\\nHe lived in a little room, all shut off from the rest of the building,\\nso that it was rather difficult to get at him. Besides, he was the very\\nlaziest and sleepiest peon possible, and though he was supposed to take\\ncare of the big building at night, patrolling it so as to keep off\\nladrones, he in reality slept so soundly that the last trumpet, much\\nless Mexican robbers, would not have roused him.\\n\\nAnd for this very reason, before settling to my work I was careful to go\\naround and look to locks and bolts myself; everything was secure, and\\nthe doors safely fastened. So that if ladrones did break through they\\nwould have to be in shape to pass through keyholes or possess false\\nkeys.\\n\\nWith never a thought of spirits or porteros, or anything else, beyond\\nthe thirteen dollars and eighty-nine cents, I worked and added and\\nre-added and footed up. And at eleven o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, grazia a Dios, I had the\\nthirteen dollars all safe, and would have whooped for joy, had I the\\ntime. However, I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t out of the woods yet, the sum of eighty-nine\\ndollars being often more easy of location than eighty-nine cents. The\\nlatter must be found, also, before I could have the pleasure of shouting\\nin celebration thereof.\\n\\nAt it I went again. After brain cudgeling and more adding and prayerful\\nthought I at last had under my thumb that abominable eighty cents.\\nEureka! Only nine cents out. I could get it all straight and have some\\nsleep, after all! Inspired by which thought I smothered my yawns and\\nagain began to add. I looked at my watch--ten minutes to twelve. Perhaps\\nI could get it fixed before one.\\n\\nI suppose I had worked at the nine cents for about twenty minutes. One\\nof the cash entries looked to me to be in error. I compared it with the\\nvoucher--yes, that was just where the trouble lay! Eleven\\ncents--ten--nine----\\n\\nS-t-t! Out went the lights in the twinkling of an eye--as I sat, gaping\\nin my astonishment, from out of the pitchy darkness of the room came the\\nmost dreary, horrible, blood-curdling groan imaginable. As I sat\\nparalyzed, not daring to breathe, doubting my senses for a moment, and\\nthen thinking indignantly that it was some trick of that wretched\\ncashier, I felt long, thin, icy fingers passing gently over my face.\\nMalgame Dios! what a sensation! At first I was afraid to move. Then I\\nnervously tried to brush the icy, bony things away. As fast as I\\nbrushed, with my heart beating like a steam-hammer, and gasping with\\ndeadly fear, the fingers would come back again; a cold wind was blowing\\nover me. Again came that dreadful groan, and too frightened to move or\\nscream, I tumbled in a heap on the floor, among the books and ledgers.\\nThen I suppose I fainted.\\n\\nWhen I regained my senses I was still in a heap with the ledgers; still\\nit was dark and still I felt the cold fingers caressing my face. At\\nwhich I became thoroughly desperate. No ghost should own me! I had\\nlaughed at the poor cashier and hinted darkly at cocktails. Pray, what\\nbetter was I?\\n\\nI scrambled to my feet, the fingers still stroking my face. I must\\naddress them--what language--did they understand English or Spanish, I\\nwondered? Spanish would doubtless be most suitable, if indeed, it was\\nthe ghost of the murdered count----.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you do me the favor, Senor Ghost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I started out bravely, in my\\nbest Spanish, but with a very trembling voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto inform me what it is\\nthat you desire? Is there anything I can do for you? Because, if not, I\\nwould like very much to be allowed to finish my work, which I cannot do\\n(if you will pardon my abruptness) if I am not alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n(Being the ghost of a gentleman and a diplomat, surely he would take the\\nhint and vanish. Ojala!)\\n\\nPerhaps the ghost did not understand my Spanish; at any rate there was\\nno articulate reply; there was another groan--again the fingers touched\\nme, and then there was such a mournful sigh that I felt sorry for the\\npoor thing--what could be the matter with it? With my pity, all fear was\\nlost for a moment, and I said to the darkness all about me:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it that you wish, pobre senor? Can I not aid you? I am not\\nafraid--let me help you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe fingers moved uncertainly for a moment; then the ledgers all fell\\ndown, with a loud bang; a cold hand caught mine, very gently--I tried\\nnot to feel frightened, but it was difficult--and I was led off blindly,\\nthrough the offices. I could not see a thing--not a glimmer of light\\nshowed; not a sound was heard except my own footsteps, and the faint\\nsound of the invisible something that was leading me along--there were\\nno more groans, thank goodness, else I should have shrieked and fainted,\\nwithout a doubt. Only the pattering footsteps and the cold hand that led\\nme on and on.\\n\\nWe--the fingers and I--were somehow in the great hall, then on the\\nsecond floor, and at last on the stairs, going on down, flight after\\nflight. Then I knew that I was being led about by the fingers on the\\ntiled floor of the patio, and close to the portero\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lodge. Simpleton\\nthat he was! Sleeping like a log, no doubt, while I was being led about\\nin the black darkness by an invisible hand, and no one to save me! I\\nwould have yelled, of course, but for one fact--I found it utterly\\nimpossible to speak or move my tongue, being a rare and uncomfortable\\nsensation.\\n\\nBut where were we going? Back into the unused lumber rooms, joining onto\\nthe patio? Nothing there, except barrels and slabs and empty boxes. What\\ncould the ghost mean? He must be utterly demented, surely.\\n\\nIn the middle of the first room we paused. I had an idea of rushing out\\nand screaming for the portero, but abandoned it when I found that my\\nfeet wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go. I heard steps passing to and fro about the floor, and\\nwaited, cold and trembling. They approached me; again my hand was taken,\\nand I was led over near the corner of the room. Obedient to the unseen\\nwill, I bent down and groped about the floor, guided by the cold fingers\\nholding mine, until I felt something like a tiny ring, set firmly in the\\nfloor. I pulled at it faintly, but it did not move, at which the ghost\\ngave a faint sigh. For a second the cold fingers pressed mine, quite\\naffectionately, then released me, and I heard steps passing slowly into\\nthe patio, then dying away. Where was it going, and what on earth did it\\nall mean?\\n\\nBut I was so tired and wrought up I tried to find the door, but couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\n(the cashier would have been revenged could he have seen me stupidly\\nfumbling at a barrel, thinking it was the door), and at last, too\\nfatigued and sleepy to stand, I dropped down on the cold stone floor\\nand went to sleep.\\n\\nI must have slept for some hours, for when I awoke the light of dawn was\\ncoming in at the window, and I sat up and wondered if I had taken leave\\nof my senses during the night. What on earth could I be doing here in\\nthe lumber-room? Then, like a flash, I remembered, and, half\\nunconsciously, crept about on the floor seeking the small ring. There it\\nwas! I caught it and jerked at it hard. Hey, presto, change! For it\\nseemed to me that the entire floor was giving way. There was a sliding,\\ncrashing sound, and I found myself hanging on for dear life to a barrel\\nthat, fortunately, retained its equilibrium, and with my feet dangling\\ninto space. Down below me was a small, stone-floored room, with big\\nboxes and small ones ranged about the walls. Treasure! Like a flash the\\nthought struck me, and with one leap I was down in the secret room\\ngazing about at the boxes.\\n\\nBut, alas! upon investigation, the biggest chests proved empty. The bad,\\nwicked count! No wonder he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rest in his Spanish grave, but must\\ncome back to the scene of his wickedness and deceit to make reparation!\\nBut the smaller chests were literally crammed with all sorts of\\nthings--big heavy Spanish coins, in gold and silver--gold and silver\\ndinner services, with the crest of the unfortunate emperor; magnificent\\npieces of jeweled armor and weapons, beautiful jewelry and loose\\nprecious stones. I deliberately selected handfuls of the latter, giving\\nmy preference to the diamonds and pearls--I had always had a taste for\\nthem, which I had never before been able to gratify!--and packed them in\\na wooden box that I found in the lumber-room. The gold and dinner\\nservices and armor, etc., I left as they were, being rather cumbersome,\\nand carried off, rejoicing, my big box of diamonds and pearls and other\\njewelry.\\n\\nNeedless to say we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go away for the holidays on the eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock\\ntrain. But I did come down to the office and proceeded to locate my\\nmissing nine cents. After which I unfolded the tale of the ghost and the\\ntreasure--only keeping quiet the matter of my private loot. Of which I\\nwas heartily glad afterwards. For when the government learned of the\\nfind what do you suppose they offered me for going about with the ghost\\nand discovering the secret room and treasure? Ten thousand dollars! When\\nI refused, stating that I would take merely, as my reward, one of the\\ngold dinner services, the greedy things objected at first, but I finally\\nhad my way. And to this very day they have no idea that I--even I--have\\nall the beautiful jewels. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they be furious if they knew it? But\\nthey aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t apt to, unless they learn English and read this story. Which\\nisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t likely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE OLD MANSION.\\n\\n\\nDown on Long Beach, that narrow strip of sand which stretches along the\\nNew Jersey coast from Barnegat Inlet on the north to Little Egg Harbor\\nInlet on the south, the summer sojourner at some one of the numerous\\nresorts, which of late years have sprung up every few miles, may, in\\nwandering over the sand dunes just across the bay from the village of\\nManahawkin, stumble over some charred timbers or vestiges of crumbling\\nchimneys, showing that once, years back, a human habitation has stood\\nthere. If the find rouses the jaded curiosity of the visitor\\nsufficiently to impel him to question the weatherbeaten old bayman who\\nsails him on his fishing trips he will learn that these relics mark the\\nsite of one of the first summer hotels erected on the New Jersey coast.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where the Old Mansion stood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he will be informed by Captain\\nNate or Captain Sam, or whatever particular captain it may chance to be,\\nand if by good fortune it chances to be Captain Jim, he will hear a\\nstory that will pleasantly pass away the long wait for a sheepshead\\nbite.\\n\\nIt was my good luck to have secured Captain Jim for a preceptor in the\\nangler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s art during my vacation last summer, and his stories and\\nreminiscences of Long Beach were not the least enjoyable features of the\\ntwo weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sojourn.\\n\\nCaptain Jim was not garrulous. Few of the baymen are. They are a sturdy,\\nself-reliant and self-controlled people, full of strong common sense,\\nbut still with that firm belief in the supernatural which seems inherent\\nin dwellers by the sea.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Old Mansion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Captain Jim, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor the Mansion of Health, for that\\nwas its full name, was built away back in 1822, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard my father\\nsay. There had been a tavern close by years before that was kept by a\\nman named Cranmer, and people used to come from Philadelphia by stage,\\nsixty miles through the pines, to \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hawkin, and then cross here by boat.\\nSome would stop at Cranmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and others went on down the beach to\\nHomer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s which was clear down at End by the Inlet. Finally some of the\\nwealthy people concluded that they wanted better accommodations than\\nCranmer gave, so they formed the Great Swamp Long Beach Company, and\\nbuilt the Mansion of Health. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard that when it was built it was\\nthe biggest hotel on the coast, and was considered a wonder. It was 120\\nfeet long, three stories high, and had a porch running all the way\\naround it, with a balcony on top. It was certainly a big thing for\\nthose days. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard father tell many a time of the stage loads of gay\\npeople that used to come rattling into \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hawkin, each stage drawn by four\\nhorses, and sometimes four or five of them a day in the summer. A good\\nmany people, too, used to come in their own carriages, and leave them\\nover on the mainland until they were ready to go home. There were gay\\ntimes at the Old Mansion then, and it made times good for the people\\nalong shore, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow long did the Old Mansion flourish, Captain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, for twenty-five or thirty years people came there summer after\\nsummer. Then they built a railroad to Cape May, and that, with the\\nghosts, settled the Mansion of Health.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by the ghosts?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I demanded.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, you see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Captain Jim, cutting off a mouthful of navy plug,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe story got around that the old house was haunted. Some people said\\nthere were queer things seen there, and strange noises were heard that\\nnobody could account for, and pretty soon the place got a bad name and\\nvisitors were so few that it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay to keep it open any more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut how did it get the name of being haunted, Captain Jim?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\npersisted.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, it was this way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued the mariner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard of\\nthe time early in the fifties when the Powhatan was wrecked on the beach\\nhere, and every soul on board was lost. She was an emigrant ship, and\\nthere were over 400 people aboard--passengers and crew. She came ashore\\nhere during the equinoctial storm in September. There wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any\\nlife-saving stations in them days, and everyone was drowned. You can see\\nthe long graves now over in the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hawkin churchyard, where the bodies\\nwere buried after they came ashore. They put them in three long trenches\\nthat were dug from one end of the burying-ground to the other. The only\\npeople on the beach that night was the man who took care of the old\\nmansion. He lived there with his family, and his son-in-law lived with\\nhim. He was the wreckmaster for this part of the coast, too. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ntill the second day that the people from \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hawkin could get over to the\\nbeach, and by that time the bodies had all come ashore, and the\\nwreckmaster had them all piled up on the sand. I was a youngster, then,\\nand came over with my father, and, I tell you, it was the awfullest\\nsight I ever saw--them long rows of drowned people, all lying there with\\ntheir white, still faces turned up to the sky. Some were women, with\\ntheir dead babies clasped tight in their arms, and some were husbands\\nand wives, whose bodies came ashore locked together in a death embrace.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never forget that sight as long as I live. Well, when the coroner\\ncame and took charge he began to inquire whether any money or valuables\\nhad been found, but the wreckmaster declared that not a solitary coin\\nhad been washed ashore. People thought this was rather singular, as the\\nemigrants were, most of them, well-to-do Germans, and were known to have\\nbrought a good deal of money with them, but it was concluded that it had\\ngone down with the ship. Well, the poor emigrants were given pauper\\nburial, and the people had begun to forget their suspicions until three\\nor four months later there came another storm, and the sea broke clear\\nover the beach, just below the Old Mansion, and washed away the sand.\\nNext morning early two men from \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hawkin sailed across the bay and landed\\non the beach. They walked across on the hard bottom where the sea had\\nwashed across, and, when about half way from the bay, one of the men saw\\nsomething curious close up against the stump of an old cedar tree. He\\ncalled the other man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention to it, and they went over to the stump.\\nWhat they found was a pile of leather money-belts that would have filled\\na wheelbarrow. Every one was cut open and empty. They had been buried in\\nthe sand close by the old stump, and the sea had washed away the\\ncovering. The men didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go any further.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey carried the belts to their boats and sailed back to \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hawkin as\\nfast as the wind would take them. Of course, it made a big sensation,\\nand everybody was satisfied that the wreckmaster had robbed the bodies,\\nif he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done anything worse, but there was no way to prove it, and\\nso nothing was done. The wreckmaster didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay around here long after\\nthat, though. The people made it too hot for him, and he and his family\\nwent away South, where it was said he bought a big plantation and a lot\\nof slaves. Years afterward the story came to \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hawkin somehow that he was\\nkilled in a barroom brawl, and that his son-in-law was drowned by his\\nboat upsettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 while he was out fishin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t furnish any affidavits\\nwith that part of the story, though.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever, after that nobody lived in the Old Mansion for long at a time.\\nPeople would go there, stay a week or two, and leave--and at last it was\\ngiven up entirely to beach parties in the day time, and ghosts at\\nnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, Captain, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really believe the ghost part, do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\nasked.\\n\\nCaptain Jim looked down the bay, expectorated gravely over the side of\\nthe boat, and answered, slowly:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know as I would have believed in \\xe2\\x80\\x99em if I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen the\\nghost.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou saw it? Tell me about it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always wanted\\nto see a ghost, or next best thing, a man who has seen one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was one August, about 1861,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the captain. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was a young\\nfeller then, and with a half dozen more was over on the beach cutting\\nsalt hay. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go home at nights, but did our own cooking in the\\nOld Mansion kitchen, and at nights slept on piles of hay upstairs. We\\nwere a reckless lot of scamps, and reckoned that no ghosts could scare\\nus. There was a big full moon that night, and it was as light as day.\\nThe muskeeters was pretty bad, too, and it was easier to stay awake than\\ngo to sleep. Along toward midnight me and two other fellers went out on\\nthe old balcony, and began to race around the house. We hollered and\\nyelled, and chased each other for half an hour or so, and then we\\nconcluded we had better go to sleep, so we started for the window of the\\nroom where the rest were. This window was near one end on the ocean\\nside, and as I came around the corner I stopped as if I had been shot,\\nand my hair raised straight up on top of my head. Right there in front\\nof that window stood a woman looking out over the sea, and in her arms\\nshe held a little child. I saw her as plain as I see you now. It seemed\\nto me like an hour she stood there, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose it was a second;\\nthen she was gone. When I could move I looked around for the other boys,\\nand they were standing there paralyzed. They had seen the woman, too. We\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say much, and we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep much that night, and the next night\\nwe bunked out on the beach. The rest of the crowd made all manner of\\nfun of us, but we had had all the ghost we wanted, and I never set foot\\ninside the old house after that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen did it burn down, Captain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked, as Jim relapsed into silence.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomewhere about twenty-five years ago. A beach party had been roasting\\nclams in the old oven, and in some way the fire got to the woodwork. It\\nwas as dry as tinder, and I hope the ghosts were all burnt up with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA MISFIT GHOST.\\n\\n\\nEvery boy with a knowledge of adventurous literature, otherwise \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnovels\\nof action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d knows of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cphantom ship,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the spook of the high seas.\\n\\nBut it has not been known that ships themselves are haunted, and that in\\nthe service of the United States Coast Survey there is a vessel now in\\ncommission that is by her own officers supposed to be haunted.\\n\\nYet the Eagre, a 140-foot schooner of the coast survey, is looked upon\\nin the service as a very undesirable vessel to be aboard of. About her\\nthere is an atmosphere of gloom that wardroom jest cannot dispel.\\n\\nDuty on board her has been shunned as would be a pestilence, and stories\\nhave been told by officers who have cruised aboard her that are not good\\nfor timid people to hear. Officers have hesitated about telling these\\nuncanny stories, but they have become sufficiently well known to make a\\nbillet to duty aboard the Eagre unwelcome among the coast survey men.\\n\\nThe Mohawk was launched June 10, 1875, at Greenpoint, and she was then\\nthe largest sailing yacht afloat.\\n\\nWilliam T. Garner, her young millionaire owner, was very proud of his\\nnew craft, and all the then leaders of New York society were invited to\\nparticipate in the good time afloat with which her launching was\\ncelebrated. Commodore Garner, then but thirty-three years old, and his\\nyoung wife entertained charmingly, and the trim, speedy Mohawk was\\nchristened with unusually merry festivities. Soon after that she was\\ncapsized by a sudden squall off the landing at Stapleton, N. Y., and six\\npeople were drowned like rats in her cabin and forecastle.\\n\\nThen the Mohawk was raised at a cost of $25,000 and purchased by the\\nUnited States Government for the service of the coast survey. Her name\\nwas changed to Eagre, for Jack Tar is proverbially superstitious, and\\nwith the old name it would have been impossible to ship a crew.\\n\\nLieutenant Higby King describes his initial experience when he was\\nassigned to duty on the Eagre in this way:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had her full complement of officers minus one when I boarded her at\\nNewport to complete the list. Every cabin was occupied but the port\\ncabin by the companion way, and to that I was assigned.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had a jolly wardroom mess that night, and I retired from it early,\\nas I was tired by my journey to join the vessel. The others who were\\nstill at the table regarded my retirement to the port cabin in absolute\\nsilence, having bidden me good-night. Their silence did not lead me to\\nsuspect anything, though I knew that the Eagre had once been the Mohawk.\\nMy cabin door had the usual cabin lock of brass, and the porthole was\\nalso securely fastened. There could have been no one under the bed or\\nsofa, as beneath each was a facing of solid oak paneling.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI undressed lazily and left the light burning dimly in my bracket lamp.\\nI tried conscientiously to go to sleep for I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how long with my\\nback turned to the light. The noise ceased in the wardroom after a time,\\nand I knew the others had turned in, but I felt unaccountably nervous\\nand restless. I turned over and faced the light, thoroughly wide awake,\\nand there in the single chair sat an elderly man, seemingly wrapt in\\ndeep thought. He was dressed in a blue yachting reefer, and had a long,\\ngray beard. His hands were clasped in his lap, and his eyes were\\ndowncast. His face was not pale and ghastly, as the faces of ghosts are\\npopularly supposed to be, but ruddy and weatherbeaten.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI regarded him in scared silence for I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how long, though it\\nseemed an hour when he, or it, or whatever it was, disappeared. During\\nthat time the ghost, and such I now believe it to have been, made not a\\nmotion, nor did it say anything. Presently I looked again, and it was\\ngone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt breakfast the others watched me critically as I took my seat. I had\\nnot intended to say anything about my experience, for I thought then I\\nhad seen some sort of hallucination and strongly suspected that I was\\nverging on insanity. Lieutenant Irving asked me if I had slept well. I\\nreplied that I had. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you see anything?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he inquired. I then\\nfrankly admitted that I had and described my experience. Then I learned\\nthat each one of the seven others present had tried the port cabin at\\none time or another, and each had seen the self-same apparition. It had\\nacted in exactly the same way in each case, except in the case of\\nIrving, who shot at it with his pistol, when it immediately disappeared.\\nSome of the others had been led by their curiosity to inquire if anyone\\nlost on the Mohawk resembled the figure, and found that none of the\\nunfortunate ones at all fitted the description. It had been dubbed by\\nthem the \\xe2\\x80\\x98misfit ghost.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That one experience was enough for me, and\\nafter that I, by courtesy, shared the cabin of another fellow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLieutenant Irving and others corroborate the story of Lieutenant King,\\nand as additional evidence that the Eagre is haunted, Lieutenant Irving\\ndescribes a New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eve experience of the Eagre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s officers, that is,\\nto say the least, novel in the way of supernatural manifestations.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was at mess. The first toast, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sweethearts and Wives,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 had been\\ndrunk, as it always is by Yankee sailors the world over on occasions of\\nfestivity. Everyone was feeling happy, or, as Thackeray has it,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98pleasant,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when suddenly the sliding-doors separating the wardroom from\\nthe companion way closed slowly with a loud, squeaking noise. They had\\nseldom been closed, and it took the entire strength of a man to start\\nthem from their rusty fastenings. Yet upon this occasion they started\\neasily and closed tightly, while the officers jumped to their feet in\\nbreathless astonishment. Half a dozen men hauled them open in haste, but\\nnot a soul was behind them or anywhere about. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It must be our old friend\\nof the port cabin,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suggested one, and in awe-stricken silence the\\nhealth of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98misfit ghost\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was drunk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAN UNBIDDEN GUEST.\\n\\n\\nMy cousins, Kate and Tom Howard, married at Trinity, at Easter time,\\nconcluded to commence housekeeping by taking one of those delightfully\\nexpensively furnished, unfurnished cottages, with which the fashionable\\nwatering place of W---- abounds, from whose rear windows one might\\nalmost take a plunge into the surf, the beach beginning at the back\\ndoor. They went down quite early in May, being in a great hurry to try\\ntheir domestic experiment; and, as the evenings were still cold, they\\nspent them about the open fire, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspooning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was upon one of those nights, about eleven o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, that they were\\nstartled by a noise, as of some small object falling, soon followed by\\nthe sound of heavy footsteps, and then quiet again reigned supreme. At\\nonce Tom, poker in hand, boldly started in search of the burglar,\\nfollowed by Kate, wildly clutching at his coat-tail, and in a state of\\ntremor. They looked upstairs, under the various beds, Kate suggesting\\nthat in novels they were always to be found there.\\n\\nThe dining-room was next explored, where all seemed well, and, lastly\\nthe kitchen, where they found what was evidently a solution of the\\nmystery. The burglar had entered by the back door, which was found to be\\nunlocked and slightly ajar. The first excitement subsiding, they\\nreturned again to the dining-room, where Tom, upon closer inspection,\\nthen discovered that one of a pair of quaint little pepper-pots, wedding\\ngifts, was missing, and other small articles on the sideboard had been\\nslightly disturbed.\\n\\nThe next morning, when Kate mildly remonstrated with the queen of the\\nkitchen for her carelessness, she received a shock by being told that it\\nwas her usual custom to leave the door open, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso that it would be aisy,\\nconvanient loike for the milkmaid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They parted with her, and a new maid\\nwas engaged, whose chief qualification for the place was that she was\\nmost faithful in the discharge of her duties, especially in \\xe2\\x80\\x9clocking\\nup.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhile they mourned the loss of the pepper-pot, still it seemed so\\ntrifling when they thought of that lovely repousse salad bowl, sent by\\nAunt Julia, which stood near by, that nothing was said of the loss\\noutside of the family, and the little household settled into its normal\\nstate once more of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbilling and cooing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAbout a fortnight later, Tom started out one night with an old\\nfisherman, one of the natives, and a local \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccharacter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to indulge in\\nthat delightful pastime, so dear to the heart of man, known as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ceeling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and, as the night was dark, the eels were particularly\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csporty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so that it was well on towards the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwee sma\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hours\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when Tom\\nat last returned to the cottage.\\n\\nHe found all excitement within. Kate was in hysterics, and the new maid,\\nalso weeping, was industriously applying the camphor bottle to her\\nmistress\\xe2\\x80\\x99 nose. The burglar, or ghost, as they had now decided, the\\nwindows and doors being found to be securely locked this time, had been\\nabroad again, but had succeeded in purloining nothing. His royal\\nghostship had amused himself, apparently, by simply walking about.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Tom! he had on such heavy boots and was so dreadfully bold about\\nit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kate, tearfully.\\n\\nFrom that time Kate became nervous and refused to be left alone. Tom\\nstarted whenever a door creaked, and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreasure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d departed hurriedly,\\nsaying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFaith, the house is haunted, sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter that Kate spent her days in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgirl hunting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and her nights in\\nanswering shadowy advertisements that never materialized. They tried\\nIrish, English, Dutch, and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheathen Chinee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a sprinkling of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccolored ladies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to vary the monotony. They seemed about to become\\nfamous throughout the length and breadth of the land as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe family\\nthat changes help once a week,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when they landed Treasure No. 2.\\n\\nShortly after her advent we were all asked down to W----, to help\\ncelebrate their happiness, and incidentally to christen the new dinner\\nset. We were not a little surprised at finding Kate so pale and Tom\\nrather distrait. However, after a delightful dinner, that should have\\nfilled with pleasure the most exacting bride, we adjourned to the\\npiazza, leaving the men to the contemplation of their cigars. We were\\nenthusiastic in our praise of the house, and congratulated Kate in\\nsecuring such a prize, when, to our horror, she burst into tears, and\\nsaid: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, girls, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a dreadful place; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s haunted!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then\\ntearfully proceeded with the details, until we all felt creepy and\\nsuggested the parlor and lights.\\n\\nIt was not until long afterwards that Kate discovered that Tom had also\\nrelated the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cghost story\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the men, that evening, to which Ned Harris\\nhad said, laconically, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRats,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Bob Shaw laughingly remarked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTom,\\nold chap, you really shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take your nightcap so strong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAbout the first of July the climax came. The ghost walked again, this\\ntime taking not only the remaining pepper-pot, but also a silver\\nsalt-cellar. Evidently he had a penchant for small articles, but unlike\\nformer times, everything on the sideboard was in the greatest disorder.\\nAunt Julia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salad bowl was found on the floor, and not far away the\\ncheese-dish, with its contents scattered about. This time one of the\\nwindows was found half open. A week later a note came to me from Kate,\\nsaying that she and Tom had gone to Saratoga to spend the remainder of\\nthe season with her mother.\\n\\nThe following spring Tom received a note and parcel from Mr. B----, the\\nowner of the house at W----, which read as follows:\\n\\n     DEAR MR. HOWARD: I send you by express three articles of silver,\\n     which my wife suggests may belong to you, as they are marked with\\n     your initials, namely, two silver pepper-pots and a salt-cellar;\\n     they were found, the other day, during the process of spring house\\n     cleaning, in a rat hole, behind the sideboard. I forgot to have the\\n     holes stopped up last spring, or to caution you against the water\\n     rats; the great fellows will get in, you know. Kind regards to Mrs.\\n     Howard.\\n\\nVery truly,\\n\\nJOHN B----.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next season the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGhost Club\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was organized, the badge being a small\\nsilver rat, bearing proudly aloft a tiny pepper-pot. We thoughtfully\\noffered Tom the presidency, but he declined, with offended dignity, from\\nthe effects of which I think he will never fully recover.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE DEAD WOMAN\\xe2\\x80\\x99S PHOTOGRAPH.\\n\\n\\nVirgil Hoyt is a photographer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant up at St. Paul, and a man of a\\ngood deal of taste. He has been in search of the picturesque all over\\nthe West, and hundreds of miles to the north in Canada, and can speak\\nthree or four Indian dialects, and put a canoe through the rapids. That\\nis to say, he is a man of an adventurous sort and no dreamer. He can\\nfight well and shoot well and swim well enough to put up a winning race\\nwith the Indian boys, and he can sit all day in the saddle and not dream\\nabout it at night.\\n\\nWherever he goes he uses his camera.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hoyt is in the habit of saying to those who sit with him\\nwhen he smokes his pipe, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas created in six days to be photographed.\\nMan--and especially woman--was made for the same purpose. Clouds are not\\nmade to give moisture, nor trees to cast shade. They were created for\\nthe photographer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn short, Virgil Hoyt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view of the world is whimsical, and he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nlike to be bothered with anything disagreeable. That is the reason that\\nhe loathes and detests going to a house of mourning to photograph a\\ncorpse. The horribly bad taste of it offends him partly, and partly he\\nis annoyed at having to shoulder, even for a few moments, a part of\\nsomeone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s burden of sorrow. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like sorrow, and would willingly\\ncanoe 500 miles up the cold Canadian rivers to get rid of it.\\nNevertheless, as assistant photographer, it is often his duty to do this\\nvery kind of thing.\\n\\nNot long ago he was sent for by a rich Jewish family at St. Paul to\\nphotograph the mother, who had just died. He was very much put out, but\\nhe went. He was taken to the front parlor, where the dead woman lay in\\nher coffin. It was evident that there was some excitement in the\\nhousehold and that a discussion was going on, but Hoyt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t concerned,\\nand so he paid no attention to the matter.\\n\\nThe daughter wanted the coffin turned on end, in order that the corpse\\nmight face the camera properly, but Hoyt said he could overcome the\\nrecumbent attitude and make it appear that the face was taken in the\\nposition it would naturally hold in life, and so they went out and left\\nhim alone with the dead.\\n\\nThe face was a strong and positive one, such as may often be seen among\\nJewish matrons. Hoyt regarded it with some admiration, thinking to\\nhimself that she was a woman who had been used to having her own way.\\nThere was a strand of hair out of place, and he pushed it back from her\\nbrow. A bud lifted its head too high from among the roses on her breast\\nand spoiled the contour of the chin, so he broke it off. He remembered\\nthese things later very distinctly and that his hand touched her bare\\nface two or three times.\\n\\nThen he took the photographs and left the house.\\n\\nHe was very busy at the time and several days elapsed before he was able\\nto develop the plates. He took them from the bath, in which they had\\nlain with a number of others, and went to work upon them. There were\\nthree plates, he having taken that number merely as a precaution against\\nany accident. They came up well, but as they developed he became aware\\nof the existence of something in the photograph which had not been\\napparent to his eye. The mysterious always came under the head of the\\ndisagreeable with him, and was therefore to be banished, so he made only\\na few prints and put the things away out of sight. He hoped that\\nsomething would intervene to save him from attempting an explanation.\\n\\nBut it is a part of the general perplexity of life that things do not\\nintervene as they ought and when they ought, so one day his employer\\nasked him what had become of those photographs. He\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_They left him alone with the dead._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\ntried to evade him, but it was futile, and he got out the finished\\nphotographs and showed them to him. The older man sat staring at them a\\nlong time.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoyt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, at length, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a young man, and I suppose you have\\nnever seen anything like this before. But I have. Not exactly the same\\nthing, but similar phenomena have come my way a number of times since I\\nwent into the business, and I want to tell you there are things in\\nheaven and earth not dreamt of----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I know all that tommy-rot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Hoyt, angrily, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut when anything\\nhappens I want to know the reason why, and how it is done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said his employer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen you might explain why and how the\\nsun rises.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut he humored the younger man sufficiently to examine with him the bath\\nin which the plates were submerged and the plates themselves. All was as\\nit should be. But the mystery was there and could not be done away with.\\n\\nHoyt hoped against hope that the friends of the dead woman would somehow\\nforget about the photographs, but of course the wish was unreasonable,\\nand one day the daughter appeared and asked to see the photographs of\\nher mother.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, to tell the truth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stammered Hoyt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthose didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come out as\\nwell as we could wish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut let me see them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d persisted the lady. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to look at them,\\nanyway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n[Illustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_He showed her the prints._\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hoyt, trying to be soothing, as he believed it was\\nalways best to be with women--to tell the truth, he was an ignoramus\\nwhere women were concerned--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it would be better if you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nsee them. There are reasons why----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ambled on like this, stupid man\\nthat he was, and of course the Jewess said she would see those pictures\\nwithout any further delay.\\n\\nSo poor Hoyt brought them out and placed them in her hand, and then ran\\nfor the water pitcher, and had to be at the bother of bathing her\\nforehead to keep her from fainting.\\n\\nFor what the lady saw was this: Over face and flowers and the head of\\nthe coffin fell a thick veil, the edges of which touched the floor in\\nsome places. It covered the features so well that not a hint of them was\\nvisible.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was nothing over mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the lady at length.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acquiesced Hoyt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know, because I had occasion to touch\\nher face just before I took the picture. I put some of her hair back\\nfrom her brow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does it mean, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the lady.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know better than I. There is no explanation in science. Perhaps\\nthere is some in psychology.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the lady, stammering a little and coloring, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmother was a\\ngood woman, but she always wanted her own way, and she always had it,\\ntoo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd she never would have her picture taken. She didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t admire herself.\\nShe said no one should ever see a picture of hers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hoyt, meditatively. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kept her word, hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe two stood looking at the pictures for a time. Then Hoyt pointed to\\nthe open blaze in the grate.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThrow them in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he commanded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let your father see them--don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nkeep them yourself. They wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be good things to keep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the lady, slowly. And she threw them in the\\nfire. Then Virgil Hoyt brought out the plates and broke them before her\\neyes.\\n\\nAnd that was the end of it--except that Hoyt sometimes tells the story\\nto those who sit beside him when his pipe is lighted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GHOST OF A LIVE MAN.\\n\\n\\nWe were in the South Atlantic Ocean, in the latitude of the island of\\nFernando Norohna, about 40 degrees 12 minutes south, on board the barque\\nH. G. Johnson, homeward bound from Australia. I was the only passenger,\\nand we had safely rounded Cape Horn, with the barometer at 28 degrees 18\\nminutes, and yet had somehow miraculously escaped any extremely heavy\\ngale--had had light northerly and easterly winds till we reached 20\\ndegrees, and thence the southeast trades were sending us fast on our way\\nto the equator. I sat on deck smoking my pipe, with a glorious full moon\\nshedding its bright pathway across the blue waters, and chatting with\\nthe first mate, a man some fifty-eight years of age, who had followed\\nthe sea since he was a boy. For twenty years or more he had been mate or\\ncaptain, and many and varied were the experiences he could relate. A\\nthorough sailor and skillful navigator, he was as honest as the day is\\nlong--had a heart as big as an ox and was an all-round good fellow and\\ngenial companion. Some of his yarns might be taken cum grano salis, yet\\nhe always positively assured me that he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas telling me the truth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d An\\naccount of a voyage that he made in a whaler from the Southern Ocean to\\nNew Bedford seemed to me worthy to be repeated. He had rounded Cape Horn\\nsix times and the Cape of Good Hope twenty-six times, besides making\\nmany trips across the Western Ocean and to South American ports. I give\\nhis account as near as possible in his own words:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was in \\xe2\\x80\\x9971 that I commanded the whaler Mary Jane. We had been out\\nfrom home over three years, and had on board a full cargo of whale oil,\\nbesides 2,000 pounds of whalebone, which was then worth $5 per pound. I\\nalso had been fortunate enough to find in a dead whale which we came\\nacross a large quantity of ambergris, and our hearts were all very light\\nas we began our homeward voyage, and our thoughts all tended to the\\nhearty welcome which we should receive from wives and sweethearts when\\nwe reached our journey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end. Many a night as I lay in my berth I had\\nthought with great pleasure of the amount of money that would be coming\\nto me from the proceeds of our voyage when we arrived in New Bedford.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI calculated that I had made $12,000 as my share of the proceeds of the\\nwhalebone and oil--to say nothing of the ambergris, which I well knew\\nwould bring at least $20,000, and one-half of which belonged to me. You\\ncan therefore imagine that I was well pleased with myself as we went\\nbounding along through the southeast trades. We crossed the equator in\\nlongitude 36 and soon after took strong northeast trades, and all was\\ngoing as well as I could wish. We had put the ship in perfect order,\\npainted her inside and out, and you would never have recognized her as\\nthe old whaling ship that had for three years been plying the Southern\\nOcean for whales. Never shall I forget an old bull whale that we tackled\\nabout two degrees to the south of Cape Horn--but that is another story,\\nwhich I will give you another time.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had just lost the northeast trades and were entering the Gulf\\nStream. I sat in my cabin with my chart on the table before me rolled\\nup. I had just picked our location on it, and was thinking that in a\\nweek more I should be at home, surrounded by those near and dear to me,\\nand relating to them the story of my great good fortune.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was always my custom to work up my latitude and longitude about four\\no\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon, and then after supper pick off her position on\\nthe chart, have a smoke and perhaps just before retiring a nip of grog,\\nand then at 8.30 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, as regular as a clock, I would turn in.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am a great smoker, and this day I had been smoking all the afternoon,\\nbesides having had two or three nips. We had a dog on board whom we\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x98Bosun,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 who had been out with us all the voyage, and who was\\nafraid of nothing. He had endeared himself to every man on board, and\\nwhen Bosun \\xe2\\x80\\x98took water\\xe2\\x80\\x99 something very serious was in the wind. This\\nnight as I sat in the cabin I heard a most dismal howl from Bosun, and\\ncalled out to the mate to know what was the matter with the dog. He\\nreplied that he \\xe2\\x80\\x98reckoned some of the men had been teasing him,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the\\noccurrence soon passed from my mind.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuddenly I saw someone coming down the after companion way into the\\ncabin. I supposed at first it was the mate and wondered that he had not\\nfirst spoken to me, but then I noticed that he wore clothes I had never\\nseen on the mate, and as he advanced into the cabin I saw his face. It\\nwas the face of a man I had never seen in my life. He was thin and pale\\nand haggard, and as he advanced he looked about the cabin and at the\\nrolled up chart on the table. There seemed to be an appeal in his eyes,\\nand then there swept over his face a look of intense disappointment, and\\nbefore I could move or speak, he had vanished from my sight.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I am a very practical man, and I at once straightened myself in my\\nchair and said to myself: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, old man, you have smoked one too many\\npipes to-day, or else you have had one drink too much, for you have been\\nasleep in your chair and seen a ghost.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I was quite satisfied that I\\nhad had a dream, especially as I called to the mate and asked him if he\\nhad seen anyone come below. He said no; that he had not left the deck\\nfor the last hour, and the man at the wheel, directly in front of the\\ndoor, was sure no one had entered the cabin, so I convinced myself that\\nI had had a very vivid dream--though I could not help thinking of the\\nmatter all through the next day.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock the next evening I sat in the same place with my work\\njust finished and the chart lying rolled up on the table before me, when\\nsuddenly the dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismal howl rang through the ship, and looking up I\\nsaw those same legs coming down the after companion. My hair fairly\\nstood on end, and yet to-day surely I was wide awake. I had only smoked\\none pipe all day, and had not touched a drop of liquor. The same wan,\\nemaciated figure walked into the cabin, glanced inquiringly and\\nappealingly at me, and again there spread over his face that look of\\nutter disappointment as if he had sought something and failed to find\\nit, and again he disappeared. I rushed on deck to the mate and told him\\nall I had seen during the last two nights; but he made light of it, and\\nassured me I had been asleep or smoking too much. He did not like to\\nsuggest that I had been drinking. Still, I could see that the thought\\nthat came into his mind was \\xe2\\x80\\x98The old man has seen \\xe2\\x80\\x99em again.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I gave up\\ntrying to convince him, but requested that the next night, from 8 to\\n8.30, he should sit with me in the cabin.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow the next day passed I cannot tell. I only know that my thoughts\\nnever left that ghostly visitant, and somehow I felt that the evening\\nwould reveal something to me and the spell be broken. I made up my mind\\nI would speak to the thing, whatever it was, and I felt a sort of\\nsecurity in the presence of the mate, who was a daring fellow and feared\\nneither man nor the devil. Neither rum nor tobacco passed my lips during\\nthe next day, and eight o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock found the mate and I sitting in the\\ncabin, and this time the chart lay open on the table beside us. Just as\\neight bells struck the dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premonitory wail sounded, and looking up we\\nboth saw the figure descending the cabin stairs. We both seemed frozen\\nto our seats, and the strange weirdness of the whole proceeding cast the\\nsame spell over the mate and me alike, and we were both unable to move\\nor speak. Slowly the figure proceeded into the cabin and glanced around\\nwithout a word, but with the same expectant look on his face. His form\\nwas even more wasted, his cheeks sunken and his eyes seemed almost out\\nof sight so deeply were they set in their sockets. As his eye fell on\\nthe open chart a look of supreme joy fairly irradiated his features, and\\nadvancing to the table he placed one long, bony finger on the chart,\\nheld it for a moment and then again disappeared from our sight.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor five minutes after he had left us we sat speechless. Then I managed\\nto say: \\xe2\\x80\\x98What do you think of that, Mr. Morris?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98My God! sir, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nknow--it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beyond me.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Then my eyes fell on the open chart and there\\nwhere the finger had been was a tiny spot of blood, exactly on the point\\nof longitude 63 degrees west and latitude 37 degrees north. We were then\\nonly about fifty miles distant from that position, and immediately there\\ncame to me the determination to steer the ship there; so I laid her\\ncourse accordingly, and posted a lookout in the crow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nest. At five\\no\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, just as the east began to grow gray, the lookout\\ncalled out: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Boat on the lee bow,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and as we came up to it we found four\\nmen in it--three dead and one with just a remnant of life left in him.\\nWe sewed the three bodies in canvas and buried them in the ocean, and\\nthen gave all our attention to restoring life to the poor emaciated\\nframe, which, I then recognized, was the very man who for three\\nsuccessive nights had visited me in my cabin.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy judicious and careful nursing life gradually came back to him, and\\nin four days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 time he was able to sit up and talk with me in the cabin.\\nIt seems he commanded the ship Promise, and she had taken fire and been\\ndestroyed, and all hands had to take to the boats. Ten were in the boats\\nat first, but their food had given out, and one by one he had seen them\\ndie, and one by one he had cast the bodies overboard. Finally he lost\\nconsciousness and knew not whether his three remaining companions were\\ndead or alive.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen he said he seemed in a dream to see a ship and tried to go to her\\nfor help, but just as he would be going on board of her something would\\nseem to keep him back; three times in his dreams he tried to visit this\\nship, and the last time there seemed to come to him a certain\\nsatisfaction, and he felt that he had succeeded in his object. Turning\\nto my table, he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let me take your chart; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll show you just where\\nwe were.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Stop,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said I, \\xe2\\x80\\x98don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take that chart, it is an old one and all marked\\nover. Mark your position on this new one.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He took my pencil and knife,\\nand carefully sharpened his pencil. Then, taking my dividers, he\\nmeasured his latitude and longitude and placed a pencil dot at a point\\non the clean chart. As he lifted his hand he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, excuse me,\\ncaptain, I cut my finger in sharpening the pencil and have left a drop\\nof blood on the chart.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Never mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said I, \\xe2\\x80\\x98leave it there.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And then I produced the old\\nchart and there, in an exactly corresponding place was the drop of blood\\nleft by my ghostly visitor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThen looking steadily into my face the mate solemnly added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nexplain this, sir, perhaps you can; but I can tell you on my honor it is\\nGod\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own truth that I have told you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GHOST OF WASHINGTON.\\n\\n\\nIt was early on Christmas morning when John Reilly wheeled away from a\\npicturesque little village where he had passed the previous night, to\\ncontinue his cycling tour through eastern Pennsylvania. To-day his\\nintention was to stop at Valley Forge, and then to ride on up the\\nSchuylkill Valley, visiting in turn the many points of historical\\ninterest that lay along his route. Valley Forge, his road map indicated,\\nwas but a short distance further on. All around him were the hills and\\nfields and roads over which Washington and his half-starved army had\\nforaged and roamed throughout the trying winter of 1777-8--one hundred\\nand twenty-six years ago.\\n\\nIt was a beautiful Christmas day, truly, and, as he wheeled along, young\\nReilly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts were almost equally divided between the surrounding\\npleasant scenery and the folks at home, who, he knew very well, were\\nassembling at just about the present time around a heavily laden\\nChristmas tree in the front parlor. The sun rose higher and higher and\\nReilly pedaled on down the valley, passing every now and then quaint,\\npleasant-looking farmhouses, many of which, no doubt, had been built\\nanterior to the period which had given the vicinity its history.\\n\\nArriving, finally, at a place where the road forked off in two\\ndirections, Reilly was puzzled which way to go on. There happened to be\\na dwelling close by. Accordingly he dismounted, left his wheel leaning\\nagainst a gate-post at the side of the road, and walked up a wretchedly\\nflagged walk leading to the house, with the idea of getting instructions\\nfrom its inmates.\\n\\nSituated in the center of an unkempt field of rank grass and weeds, the\\nbuilding lay back from the highway probably one hundred and fifty feet.\\nIt was long and low in shape, containing but one story and having what\\nis termed a gabled roof, under which there must have been an attic of no\\nmean size. On coming close to the house, a fact Reilly had not noticed\\nfrom the road became plainly evident. It was deserted. He saw that the\\nroof and side shingles were in wretched condition; that the window\\nsashes and frames as well as the doors and door frames were missing from\\nthe openings in the side walls where once they had been, and that the\\nentire side of the house, including that part of the stone foundation\\nwhich showed above the ground, was full of cracks and seams. At first on\\nthe point of turning back, he concluded to see what the interior was\\nlike anyway.\\n\\nAccordingly he went inside. Glancing around the large dust-filled room\\nhe had entered his gaze at first failed to locate any object of the\\nleast interest. A rickety appearing set of steps went up into the attic\\nfrom one side of the apartment and over in one corner was a large open\\nfireplace, from the walls of which much of the brickwork had become\\nloosened and fallen out. Reilly had started up the steps toward the\\nattic, when happening to look back for an instant, his attention was\\nattracted to a singular-looking, jug-shaped bottle no larger than a\\nvinegar cruet, which lay upon its side on the hearth of the fireplace,\\npartly covered up by debris of loose bricks and mortar. He hastened back\\ndown the steps and crossed the room, taking the bottle up in his hand\\nand examining it with curiosity. Being partly filled with a liquid of\\nsome kind or other the bottle was very soon uncorked and held under the\\nyoung man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nose. The liquid gave forth a peculiar, pungent and inviting\\nodor. Without further hesitation Reilly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lips sought the neck of the\\nbottle. It is hardly possible to describe the pleasure and satisfaction\\nhis senses experienced as he drank.\\n\\nWhile the fluid was still gurgling down his throat a heavy hand was\\nplaced most suddenly on his shoulder and his body was given a violent\\nshaking. The bottle fell to the floor and was broken into a hundred\\npieces.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a rough voice almost in Reilly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ear. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you,\\nanyway? And what are you doing within the lines? A spy, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be bound.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs most assuredly there had been no one else in the vicinity of the\\nbuilding when he had entered it and with equal certainty no one had come\\ndown the steps from the attic, Reilly was naturally surprised and\\nmystified by this unexpected assault. He struggled instinctively to\\nbreak loose from the unfriendly grasp, and when he finally succeeded he\\ntwisted his body around so that he faced across the room. Immediately he\\nmade the remarkable discovery that there were four other persons in the\\napartment--three uncouth-looking fellows habited in fantastic but ragged\\ngarments, and a matronly-looking woman, the latter standing over a\\nwashtub which had been elevated upon two chairs in a corner near the\\nfireplace. To all appearance the woman had been busy at her work and had\\nstopped for the moment to see what the men were going to do; her waist\\nsleeves were rolled up to the shoulders and her arms dripped with water\\nand soapsuds. Over the tops of the tubs, partly filled with water, there\\nwere visible the edges of several well-soaked fabrics. Too add to his\\nastonishment he noticed that in the chimney-place, which a moment before\\nwas falling apart, but now seemed to be clean and in good condition, a\\ncheerful fire burned, and that above the flames was suspended an iron\\npot, from which issued a jet of steam. He noticed also that the entire\\nappearance of the room had undergone a great change. Everything seemed\\nto be in good repair, tidy and neat; the ceilings, the walls and the\\ndoor; even the stairway leading to the attic. The openings in the walls\\nwere fitted with window sashes and well-painted doors. The apartment\\nhad, in fact, evolved under his very eyesight from a state of absolute\\nruin into one of excellent preservation.\\n\\nAll of this seemed so weird and uncanny, that Reilly stood for a moment\\nor two in the transformed apartment, utterly dumbfounded, with his mouth\\nwide open and his eyes all but popping out of his head. He was brought\\nto his senses by the fellow who had shaken him growling out:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome! Explain yourself!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn explanation is due me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reilly managed to gasp.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bandy words with the rascal, Harry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one of the other men spoke\\nup. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring him along to headquarters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThereupon, without further parley, the three men marched Reilly in\\nmilitary fashion into the open air and down to the road. Here he picked\\nup at the gate-post his bicycle, while they unstacked a group of three\\nold-fashioned-looking muskets located close by. When the young man had\\nentered the house a few minutes before, this stack of arms had not been\\nthere. He could not understand it. Neither could he understand, on\\nlooking back at the building as he was marched off down the road, the\\nmysterious agency that had transformed its dilapidated exterior, just as\\nhad been the interior, into a practically new condition.\\n\\nWhile they trudged along, the strangers exhibited a singular interest in\\nthe wheel Reilly pushed at his side, running their coarse hands over the\\nframe and handle-bar, and acting on the whole as though they never\\nbefore had seen a bicycle. This in itself was another surprise. He had\\nhardly supposed there were three men in the country so totally\\nunacquainted with what is a most familiar piece of mechanism everywhere.\\n\\nAt the same time that they were paying so much attention to the wheel,\\nReilly in turn was studying with great curiosity his singular-looking\\ncaptors. Rough, unprepossessing appearing fellows they were, large of\\nframe and unshaven, and, it must be added, dirty of face. What remained\\nof their very ragged clothing, he had already noticed, was of a most\\nremarkable cut and design, resembling closely the garments worn by the\\nContinental militiamen in the War of Independence. The hats were broad,\\nlow of crown, and three-cornered in shape; the trousers were\\nbuff-colored and ended at the knees, and the long, blue spike-tailed\\ncoats were flapped over at the extremities of the tails, the flaps being\\nfastened down with good-sized brass buttons. Leather leggings were\\nstrapped around cowhide boots, through the badly worn feet of which, in\\nplaces where the leather had cracked open, the flesh, unprotected by\\nstockings, could be seen. Dressed as he was, in a cleanly, gray cycling\\ncostume, Reilly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance, most assuredly, was strongly in contrast\\nto that of his companions.\\n\\nAfter a brisk walk of twenty minutes, during which they occasionally met\\nand passed by one or two or perhaps a group of men clothed and outfitted\\nlike Reilly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s escorts, the little party followed the road up a slight\\nincline and around a well-wooded bend to the left, coming quite\\nsuddenly, and to the captive, very unexpectedly, to what was without\\ndoubt a military encampment; a village, in fact, composed of many rows\\nof small log huts. Along the streets, between the buildings, muskets\\nwere stacked in hundreds of places. Over in one corner, on a slight\\neminence commanding the road up which they had come, and cleverly hidden\\nfrom it behind trees and shrubbery, the young man noticed a battery of\\nfield pieces. Wherever the eye was turned on this singular scene were\\ncountless numbers of soldiers all garmented in three-cornered hats,\\nspike-tailed coats and knee breeches, walking lazily hither and thither,\\ngrouped around crackling fires, or parading up and down the streets in\\nplatoons under the guidance of ragged but stern-looking officers.\\n\\nHarry stopped the little procession of four in front of one of the\\nlarger of the log houses. Then, while they stood there, the long blast\\nfrom a bugle was heard, followed by the roll of drums. A minute or two\\nafterward, several companies of militia marched up and grounded their\\narms, forming three sides of a hollow square around them, the fourth\\nand open side being toward the log house. Directly succeeding this\\nmaneuver there came through the doorway of the house and stepped up the\\ncenter of the square, stopping directly in front of Reilly, a\\ndignified-looking person, tall and straight and splendidly proportioned\\nof figure, and having a face of great nobility and character.\\n\\nThe cold chills chased one another down Reilly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back. His limbs swayed\\nand tottered beneath his weight. He had never experienced another such\\nsensation of mingled astonishment and fright.\\n\\nHe was in the presence of General Washington. Not a phantom Washington,\\neither, but Washington in the flesh and blood; as material and earthly a\\nbeing as ever crossed a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s line of vision. Reilly, in his time,\\nhad seen so many portraits, marble busts and statues of the great\\ncommander that he could not be mistaken. Recovering the use of his\\nfaculties, which for the moment he seemed to have lost, Reilly did the\\nvery commonplace thing that others before him have done when placed\\nunexpectedly in remarkable situations. He pinched himself to make sure\\nthat he was in reality wide awake and in the natural possession of his\\nsenses. He felt like pinching the figure in front of him also, but he\\ncould not muster up the courage to do that. He stood there trying to\\nthink it all out, and as his thoughts became less stagnant, his fright\\ndissolved under the process of reasoning his mind pursued. To reason a\\nthing out, even though an explanation can only be obtained by leaving\\nmuch of the subject unaccounted for, tends to make one bolder and less\\nshaky in the knees.\\n\\nThe series of strange incidents which he was experiencing had been\\ninaugurated in the old-fashioned dwelling he had visited after\\ninformation concerning the roads. And everything had been going along in\\na perfectly normal way up to, the very moment when he had taken a drink\\nfrom the bottle found in the fireplace. But from that precise time\\neverything had gone wrongly. Hence the inference that the drinking of\\nthe peculiar liquid was accountable in some way or other for his\\ntroubles. There was a supernatural agency in the whole thing. That much\\nmust be admitted. And whatever that agency was, and however it might be\\naccounted for, it had taken Reilly back into a period of time more than\\na hundred years ago, and landed him, body and soul, within the lines of\\nthe patriot forces wintering at Valley Forge. He might have stood there,\\nturning over and over in his mind, pinching himself and muttering, all\\nthe morning, had not the newcomer ceased a silent but curious inspection\\nof his person, and asked: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn Reilly, at your pleasure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the young man replied, adding a\\nquestion on his own account: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who are you, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nImmediately he received a heavy thump on his back from Harry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard\\nfist.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not for you to question the general,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the ragged administrator of\\nthe blow exclaimed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it is not for you to be so gay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reilly returned, angrily, giving\\nthe blow back with added force.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere, here!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d broke in the first questioner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFisticuffs under my very\\nnose! No more of this, I command you both.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To Harry he added an extra\\ncaution: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour zeal in my behalf will be better appreciated by being\\nless demonstrative. Blows should be struck only on the battlefield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To\\nReilly he said, with a slight smile hovering over his face, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy name is\\nWashington. Perhaps you may have heard of me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo this Reilly replied: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have, indeed, and heard you very well spoken\\nof, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Emboldened by the other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smile, he ventured another question:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think my reckoning of the day and year is badly at fault. An hour ago\\nI thought the day was Christmas day. How far out of the way did my\\ncalculation take me, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe day is indeed Christmas day, and the year is, as you must know, the\\nyear of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nReilly again pinched himself.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do you bring this man to me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Washington now inquired, turning to\\nHarry and his companions.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a spy, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a lie!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reilly indignantly interpolated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have done nothing\\nto warrant any such charge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe found him in the Widow Robin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, pouring strong liquor down his\\nthroat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had gone inside after information concerning the roads----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich he was getting from a bottle, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf drinking from a bottle of necessity constitutes being a spy, I fear\\nour camp is already a hotbed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Washington somewhat sagely remarked,\\ncasting his eye around slyly at his officers and men. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went\\non, with sudden sternness, looking Reilly through and through, as though\\nto read his very thoughts, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis the charge true? Do you come from Howe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe charge is not true, sir. I come from no one. I simply am making a\\ntour of pleasure through this part of the country on my bicycle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the country swarming with the men from two hostile armies, any\\nkind of a tour, save one of absolute necessity, seems ill-timed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I set out I knew nothing about any armies. The fact is, sir----\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nReilly started to make an explanation, but he checked himself on\\nrealizing that the telling of any such improbable yarn would only\\nincrease the hazardousness of his position.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Washington questioned, in a tone of growing suspicion.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly did not know that your army or any other army was\\nquartered in this vicinity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reilly hesitated for lack of something\\nfurther to say. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he finally added, prompted by a happy idea,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rode my wheel from New York.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may have come from New York, though it is hard to believe you came\\non that singular-looking machine so great a distance. Where is the horse\\nwhich drew the vehicle?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nReilly touched his bicycle. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the horse, sir, just as it is; the\\nvehicle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe man is crazy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harry exclaimed. Washington only looked the\\nincredulity he felt, and this time asked a double question.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can the thing be balanced without it be held upright by a pair of\\nshafts from a horse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back, and how is the motive power acquired?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor an answer Reilly jumped upon the wheel, and at a considerable speed\\nand in a haphazard way pedaled around the space within the hollow square\\nof soldiers. Hither and thither he went, at one second nearly wheeling\\nover the toes of the line of astonished, if not frightened, militiamen;\\nat the next, bearing suddenly down on Harry and his companions and\\nmaking them dance and jump about most alertly to avoid a collision. Even\\nthe dignified Washington was once or twice put to the necessity of\\ndodging hurriedly aside when his equilibrium was threatened. Reilly\\neventually dismounted, doing so with assumed clumsiness by stopping the\\nwheel at Harry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back and falling over heavily against the soldier.\\nHarry tumbled to the ground, but Reilly dexterously landed on his feet.\\nAt once he began offering a profusion of apologies.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou did that by design!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harry shouted, jumping to his feet. His face\\nwas red with anger and he shook his fist threateningly at the bicyclist.\\n\\nWashington commanded the man to hold his peace. Then to Reilly he\\nexpressed a great surprise at his performance and a desire to know more\\nabout the bicycle. The young man thereupon described the machine\\nminutely, lifting it into the air and spinning the wheels to illustrate\\nhow smoothly they rotated.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can see it is possible to ride the contrivance with rapidity. It has\\nbeen put together with wonderful ingenuity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Washington said, when\\nReilly had replaced the wheel on the ground.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you, sir, it is but a toy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an officer spoke up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut our friend on\\nhis bundle of tin and race him against one of our horsemen and he would\\nmake a sorry showing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nReilly smiled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI bear the gentleman no ill-will for his opinion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStill, I should like to show him by a practical test of the\\nsubject that his ignorance of it is most profound.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou would test the speed of the machine against that of a horse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWashington said, in amazement.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would, sir. You have a good road yonder. With your permission and a\\nworthy opponent I would make the test at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, sir, the man is a spy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harry broke in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould it not be better to\\nthrow a rope around his neck and give him his deserts?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe charge is by no means proven,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Washington replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNor can it be\\nuntil a court martial convenes this afternoon. And I see no reason why\\nwe may not in the meantime enjoy the unique contest which has been\\nsuggested. It will make a pleasant break in the routine of camp life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA murmur of approval went up from the masses of men by whom they were\\nsurrounded. While they had been talking it seemed as though everybody in\\nthe camp not already on the scene had gathered together behind the\\nsquare of infantry.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harry said, with some eagerness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would like to be the\\nman to ride the horse. There is no better animal than mine anywhere. And\\nI understand his tricks and humors quite well enough to put him to his\\nbest pace.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI confess I have heard you well spoken of as a horseman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Washington\\nsaid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe away with you! Saddle and bridle your horse at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was the chain of singular circumstances narrated above which brought\\nJohn Reilly into the most remarkable contest of his life. He had entered\\nmany bicycle races at one time or other, always with credit to himself\\nand to the club whose colors he wore. And he had every expectation of\\nmaking a good showing to-day. Yet a reflection of the weird conditions\\nwhich had brought about the present contest took away some of his\\nself-possession when a few minutes later he was marched over to the\\nturnpike and left to his own thoughts, while the officers were pacing\\nout a one mile straightaway course down the road.\\n\\nAfter the measurements had been taken, two unbroken lines of soldiers\\nwere formed along the entire mile; a most evident precaution against\\nReilly leaving the race course at any point to escape across the fields.\\nWashington came up to him again, when the preparations were completed,\\nto shake his hand and whisper a word or two of encouragement in his ear.\\nHaving performed these kindly acts he left to take up a position near\\nthe point of finish.\\n\\nThe beginning of the course was located close to the battery of half\\nconcealed field pieces. Reilly was now conducted to this place. Shortly\\nafterward Harry appeared on his horse. He leered at the bicyclist\\ncontemptuously and said something of a sarcastic nature partly under his\\nbreath when the two lined up, side by side, for the start. To these\\nslights Reilly paid no heed; he had a strong belief that when the race\\nwas over there would be left in the mutton-like head of his opponent\\nvery little of his present inclination toward the humorous. The\\nsoldier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mount was a handsome black mare, fourteen and a half hands\\nhigh; strong of limbs and at the flanks, and animated by a spirit that\\nkept her prancing around with continuous action. It must be admitted\\nthat the man rode very well. He guided the animal with ease and\\nnonchalance when she reared and plunged, and kept her movements confined\\nto an incredibly small piece of ground, considering her abundance of\\naction.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep to your own side of the road throughout the race. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to\\nbe collided with by your big beast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reilly cautioned, while they were\\nawaiting two signals from the starter.\\n\\nTo this Harry replied in some derision, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you a good share of\\nthe road at the start, and all of it and my dust, too, afterward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And\\nthen the officer who held the pistol fired the first shot.\\n\\nReilly was well satisfied with the conditions under which the race was\\nto be made. The road was wide and level, smooth, hard and straight, and\\na strong breeze which had sprung up, blew squarely against his back. His\\nwheel was geared up to eighty-four inches; the breeze promised to be a\\nvaluable adjunct in pushing it along. Awaiting the second and last\\nsignal, Reilly glanced down the two blue ranks of soldiers, which\\nstretched away into hazy lines in the distance and converged at the\\ntermination of the course where a flag had been stuck into the ground.\\nThe soldiers were at parade rest. Their unceasing movements as they\\nchatted to one another, turning their bodies this way and that and\\ncraning their heads forward to look toward the starting point, and then\\njerking them back, made the lines seem like long, squirming snakes. At\\nthe end of the course a thick bunch of militiamen clogged the road and\\noverspread into the fields.\\n\\nCrack! The signal to be off. Reilly shoved aside the fellow who had been\\nholding his wheel upright while astride of it, and pushed down on the\\npedals. The mare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hoofs dug the earth; her great muscular legs\\nstraightened out; she sprang forward with a snort of apparent pleasure,\\ntaking the lead at the very start. Reilly heard the shout of excitement\\nrun along the two ranks of soldiers. He saw them waving their arms and\\nhats as he went by. And on ahead through the cloud of dust there was\\nvisible the shadow-like outlines of the snorting, galloping horse, whose\\nhoof beats sounded clear and sharp above the din which came from the\\nsides of the highway. The mare crept farther and farther ahead. Very\\nsoon a hundred feet or more of the road lay between her and the\\nbicyclist. Harry turned in his saddle and called out another sarcasm.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall pass you very soon. Keep to your own side of the road!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reilly\\nshouted, not a bit daunted by the way the race had commenced. His head\\nwas well down over the handle-bars, his back had the shape of the upper\\nportion of an immense egg. Up and down his legs moved; faster and\\nfaster and faster yet. He went by the soldiers so rapidly that they only\\nappeared to be two streaks of blurry color. Their sharp rasping shouts\\nsounded like the cracking of musketry. The cloud of dust blew against\\nthe bicyclist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head and into his mouth and throat. When he glanced\\nahead again he saw with satisfaction that the mare was no longer\\nincreasing her lead. It soon became evident even that he was slowly\\ncutting down the advantages she had secured.\\n\\nHarry again turned his head shortly afterward, doubtless expecting to\\nfind his opponent hopelessly distanced by this time. Instead of this\\nReilly was alarmingly close upon him. The man ejaculated a sudden oath\\nand lashed his animal furiously. Straining every nerve and sinew the\\nmare for the moment pushed further ahead. Then her pace slackened a bit\\nand Reilly again crept up to her. Closer and closer to her than before,\\nuntil his head was abreast of her outstretched tail. Harry was lashing\\nthe mare and swearing at her unceasingly now. But she had spurted once\\nand appeared to be incapable of again increasing her speed. In this way\\nthey went on for some little distance, Harry using his whip brutally,\\nthe mare desperately struggling to attain a greater pace, Reilly hanging\\non with tenacity to her hind flanks and giving up not an inch of ground.\\n\\nA mile is indeed a very short distance when traversed at such a pace.\\nThe finishing flag was already but a few hundred feet further on.\\nReilly realized that it was time now to go to the front. He gritted his\\nteeth together with determination and bent his head down even further\\ntoward his front wheel. Then his feet began to move so quickly that\\nthere was only visible an indistinct blur at the sides of his crank\\nshaft. At this very second, with a face marked with rage and hatred,\\nHarry brought his horse suddenly across the road to thet part of it\\nwhich he had been warned to avoid.\\n\\nIt is hard to tell what kept Reilly from being run into and trampled\\nunder foot. An attempt at back pedaling, a sudden twist of the\\nhandle-bar, a lurch to one side that almost threw him from his seat.\\nThen, in the fraction of a second he was over on the other side of the\\nroad, pushing ahead of the mare almost as though she were standing\\nstill. The outburst of alarm from the throats of the soldiers changed\\nwhen they saw that Reilly had not been injured; first into a shout of\\nindignation at the dastardly attempt which had been made to run him\\ndown, and then into a roar of delight when the bicyclist breasted the\\nflag a winner of the race by twenty feet.\\n\\nAs he crossed the line Reilly caught a glimpse of Washington. He stood\\nclose to the flag and was waving his hat in the air with the enthusiasm\\nof a schoolboy. Reilly went on down the road slackening his speed as\\neffectively as he could. But before it was possible to entirely stop\\nhis wheel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s momentum the noisy acclamations in his rear ceased with\\nstartling suddenness. He turned in his saddle and looked back. As sure\\nas St. Peter he had the road entirely to himself. There wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a soldier\\nor the ghost of a soldier in sight.\\n\\nAs soon as he could he turned his bicycle about and rode slowly back\\nalong the highway, now so singularly deserted, looking hither and\\nthither in vain for some trace of the vanished army. Even the flag which\\nhad been stuck into the ground at the end of the one-mile race course\\nwas gone. The breeze had died out again and the air was tranquil and\\nwarm. In the branches of a nearby tree two sparrows chirped and\\ntwittered peacefully. Reilly went back to the place where the camp had\\nbeen. He found there only open fields on one side of the road and a\\nclump of woodland on the other. He continued on down the little hill up\\nwhich Harry and his companions had brought him a few hours previously\\nand followed the road on further, coming finally to the fork in it near\\nwhich was located the old farmhouse wherein he had been taken captive.\\nThe house was, as it had been when he had previously entered it, falling\\napart from age and neglect. When he went inside he found lying on the\\nbrick hearth in front of the fireplace a number of pieces of broken\\nglass.\\n\\n                               THE END.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n                          True Ghost Stories\\n\\n                        BY HEREWARD CARRINGTON\\n\\n                            [Illustration]\\n\\nThe author of this book is well known in both America and Europe as a\\nprominent scientific writer on psychical and occult subjects.
